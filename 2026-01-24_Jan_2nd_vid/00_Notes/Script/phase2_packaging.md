## Step 1: Concept Validation (4 Avatar Questions)

### 1. Avatar: Who is this for?
**Specific person**: A 20-35 year old developer/content creator who's using AI coding tools (Cursor, Claude Code, Antigravity) but frustrated that the AI makes UGLY designs. They know how to code but aren't designers. They want their projects to look professional without hiring a designer.

### 2. Objection: What do they currently believe?
- "AI is bad at design - I just have to live with it"
- "I need to manually specify every color/font/spacing"
- "Skills are complicated to set up"
- "I need expensive tools or subscriptions"

### 3. Stakes: What do they LOSE if they scroll past?
- Keep wasting time on ugly AI-generated UIs
- Keep manually fixing colors and fonts every project
- Miss out on a FREE system that makes AI design like a pro
- Stay stuck at "developer design" level

### 4. Transformation: Dream Outcome
**Before**: AI spits out generic Bootstrap-looking garbage
**After**: AI generates production-ready designs with proper color theory, typography, and UX patterns - like having a design team in your terminal

| 1 | **Open Loop** | "The AI Design Hack Nobody's Talking About" | Curiosity | Gap: What's the hack? Simple, broad appeal |
| 2 | **Counterintuitive** | "Stop Telling AI What Colors to Use" | Negativity | Challenges the belief that you need to specify everything |
| 3 | **Secret** | "The Design System I Stole From a Senior Designer (AI Version)" | Curiosity | Implies insider knowledge, "stolen" adds intrigue |
| 4 | **Extreme** | "I Gave AI a Design Brain (It's Insane)" | Desire | Visceral result, "insane" = extreme |
| 5 | **Negative List** | "Why Your AI Designs Look Like Garbage (And How to Fix It)" | Negativity | Calls out the pain, offers solution |
| 6 | **Constraint** | "I Made AI Design Without Giving It Any Instructions" | Curiosity | How is that possible? Constraint creates intrigue |
| 7 | **Future** | "AI Design in 2026: You Don't Need Figma Anymore" | Desire | Future state, removes pain (Figma learning curve) |
| 8 | **Contrast** | "Cheap AI vs $200/mo AI: Which Designs Better?" | Curiosity | Comparison, implies you'll find out the cheap one wins |
| 9 | **Question** | "Can AI Actually Design? (I Built a Skill to Find Out)" | Curiosity | Question invites click, hints at the experiment |
| 10 | **Weird** | "I Taught AI Color Theory (Here's What Happened)" | Curiosity | Weird concept - teaching AI abstract concepts |
