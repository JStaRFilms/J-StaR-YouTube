# 📌 PHASE 3 OUTPUT: FINAL SCRIPT

## "Why Your AI Designs Look Like Garbage (And How to Fix It)"

> **Duration**: ~16 minutes
> **Avatar**: Dev/creator frustrated with ugly AI designs
> **Stakes**: Keep wasting time on garbage UIs

---

# [HOOK: 0:00-0:45]

## First Frame (0:00-0:05)
> "You think AI is bad at design... but the real problem is YOU haven't taught it how."

[VISUAL: Match thumbnail - before/after split screen]

## Context & Stakes (0:05-0:15)
> "Every time you prompt an AI to build something, it spits out the same generic gray boxes with random fonts. You fix it manually... again. Meanwhile, my AI generates production-ready designs on the first try."

[VISUAL: Quick flash of ugly AI output vs beautiful output]

## Input Bias Flex (0:15-0:30)
> "I spent 6 months testing this across 20+ real projects - school websites, clinics, churches, personal side projects. I analyzed dozens of design systems so you don't have to."

[VISUAL: Montage of project screenshots]

## Payoff Promise (0:30-0:45)
> "By the end of this video, you'll have a free design skill installed that makes ANY AI - even cheap models - design like a senior designer. I'll show you the before and after - and trust me, the difference is insane."

[VISUAL: Teaser of the transformation]

# [BREAKING BELIEFS: 0:45-1:30]

## The Old Way
> "Most people think the solution is to give AI more detailed prompts. 'Use Inter font, use this exact hex code, add 16px padding...' But that's exhausting."

[VISUAL: Screen recording of long, detailed prompt]

## The Breakdown
> "The problem is AI doesn't UNDERSTAND why those choices work. It's just following orders without any design knowledge."

## The New Mechanism
> "What if instead of telling AI WHAT to do... you taught it HOW to think about design? That's what a skill does."

[VISUAL: Diagram - "Instructions" vs "Knowledge"]

---

# [POINT 1: The Problem - 1:30-3:30]

## Open Loop
> "Before we fix anything, let me show you how bad it really is. I'm going to ask a vanilla AI to build a landing page... and I want you to cringe with me."

## Content
> "This is what 99% of AI users get."

[VISUAL: Screen recording - prompting vanilla AI]

> "Generic. Boring. Unusable. I used to spend HOURS fixing colors and fonts after every generation. It was painful."

[VISUAL: Show the ugly output]

> "The AI has no concept of color harmony, typography pairing, or UX patterns. It's guessing."

## Payoff
> "This is the garbage. Now let's turn it into gold."

## Bridge
> "The fix isn't more detailed prompts... it's giving AI a design brain. Here's how."

---

# [POINT 2: The Solution Overview - 3:30-5:30]

## Open Loop
> "So how do we actually teach AI to design? Two words: Skills and Workflows."

## Content
> "Skills are files that teach AI new abilities. Workflows tell it WHEN to use them."

[VISUAL: Folder structure diagram]

> "I found this UI/UX Pro Max skill online - 50+ styles, 97 color palettes, 57 font pairings... it's insane."

[VISUAL: Show the skill file briefly]

> "I combined it with my own workflow called init_vibecode_design. Together, they create a design system engine."

> "And here's the key difference from MCP servers: skills only load when the AI decides to use them. They don't eat your context from the start."

## Payoff
> "You get a design system engine that runs automatically."

## Bridge
> "Let me show you how to set this up in 60 seconds..."

---

# [POINT 3: Installation & Setup - 5:30-7:30]

## Open Loop
> "Here's where most people get scared - but don't. This is literally copy-paste."

## Content
> "Drop these files in your skills folder. Done."

[VISUAL: Screen recording - copying files]

> "I actually forked the original repo to add global directory installation - the creators made it work only in your current directory with npm install. My version works globally."

> "Step one: go to your global skills folder. Step two: copy my forked UI/UX skill. Step three: copy my workflow. That's it. The AI reads them automatically."

[VISUAL: Show the final folder structure]

> "Skills are just markdown files plus scripts. No complex setup."

## Payoff
> "You now have a design brain installed."

## Bridge
> "But using it is the fun part. Let me run the workflow and show you what happens..."

---

# [POINT 4: Live Demo - The Workflow - 7:30-12:00]

## Open Loop
> "Watch what happens when I tell the AI to design something NOW..."

## Content
[VISUAL: Full screen recording of workflow running]

> "I run the workflow. It starts by interviewing me about the project - what's the vibe? What industry? Dark mode or light?"

[VISUAL: Show the interview process]

> "Based on my answers, it searches the skill database. 97 researched color palettes matched to product types. It picks the right one automatically."

[VISUAL: Show the design system being generated]

> "Then it generates a complete design system. Colors. Typography. Spacing. Components. All production-ready."

> "And finally, it creates page mockups. Look at that. Proper colors. Proper typography. Proper spacing."

[VISUAL: Show the final mockups]

[30-SEC SNAP: Side-by-side before/after]

> "The first time I ran this, I was shocked. It just... worked."

## Payoff
> "That's the same AI that made garbage before. Same model. Different result."

## Bridge
> "But you might be thinking... does this actually work, or did I just get lucky? Let's put it to the test."

---

# [POINT 5: The 3-Way Comparison - 12:00-15:00]

## Open Loop
> "Same prompt. Three different setups. Which one wins?"

## Content
> "I'm going to build a landing page for a premium crypto wallet app called VaultX. Dark mode, modern aesthetic."

[VISUAL: Show the prompt]

> "Test one: Vanilla AI. No skills, no workflow."

[VISUAL: Show ugly output]

> "Garbage. Generic gray, wrong fonts, no cohesion."

> "Test two: My workflow only. The process, but without the skill database."

[VISUAL: Show medium output]

> "Better. It asked the right questions. But the colors are still... meh."

> "Test three: Workflow plus the UI/UX skill. The full stack."

[VISUAL: Show beautiful output]

> "Look at that. Professional. Proper contrast, proper spacing, proper everything."

[VISUAL: Split screen - all 3 side by side]

## Payoff
> "The skill doesn't just make it prettier - it makes it CORRECT. Actual design principles applied automatically."

## Bridge
> "And here's the craziest part..."

---

# [POINT 6: Weak Model Flex (Bonus) - 15:00-16:00]

## Open Loop
> "What if you can't afford Claude or GPT-4? Watch this."

## Content
> "I ran the exact same test with [cheaper model name]. A model that's supposed to be worse at everything."

[VISUAL: Screen recording with cheap model]

> "Look at that output. Still professional. Still proper colors and typography."

## Payoff
> "Even [model name] produced this with no stress. The skill is doing the heavy lifting - compensating for the model's limitations."

> "This means you don't need expensive subscriptions. You need the right skills."

---

# [OUTRO & CTA: 16:00-17:00]

## Link the Problem
> "Now you have the design skill. Your AI can create beautiful mockups. But what about actually building the app? The code?"

## The Solution
> "That's where my coding workflow comes in. Same AI, same skills approach - but for turning these mockups into working applications."

## The CTA
> "If you want to see how I turn these designs into real, deployable apps without writing code manually, watch this next."
