# PART 1: THE HOOK (0:00 - 0:45)

## Step 1.1: First Frame Statement (0:00-0:05)

**Pick one:**

### Option A: The Ego Trap (Recommended)
> "You think AI is bad at design... but the real problem is YOU haven't taught it how."

### Option B: The Secret
> "There's a reason your AI designs look like garbage... and it's not the AI's fault."

### Option C: The Negative Warning
> "Stop manually picking colors for your AI. Here's why."

---

## Step 1.2: Context & Stakes (0:05-0:15)

**Draft:**
> "Every time you prompt an AI to build something, it spits out the same generic gray boxes with random fonts. You fix it manually... again. Meanwhile, my AI generates production-ready designs on the first try."

**Alt (Fear toggle):**
> "If you keep doing this the hard way, you'll waste hours on every project fixing ugly AI output while developers with skills do it in seconds."

---

## Step 1.3: Input Bias Flex (0:15-0:30)

**Draft:**
> "I spent 6 months testing this across 20+ real projects - school websites, clinics, churches, personal side projects. I analyzed dozens of design systems so you don't have to."

---

## Step 1.4: Payoff Promise (0:30-0:45)

**Draft:**
> "By the end of this video, you'll have a free design skill installed that makes ANY AI - even cheap models - design like a senior designer. I'll show you exactly how it works, and you'll see the before and after."

---

## HOOK DRAFT (Full 45 seconds)

```
[0:00-0:05 - FIRST FRAME]
"You think AI is bad at design... but the real problem is YOU haven't taught it how."

[0:05-0:15 - STAKES]
"Every time you prompt an AI to build something, it spits out the same generic gray boxes with random fonts. You fix it manually... again. Meanwhile, my AI generates production-ready designs on the first try."

[0:15-0:30 - INPUT BIAS]
"I spent weeks building a custom design skill that teaches AI proper color theory, typography, and UX patterns. So now you don't have to."

[0:30-0:45 - PAYOFF PROMISE]
"By the end of this video, you'll have a free design skill installed that makes ANY AI - even cheap models - design like a senior designer. I'll show you the before and after - and trust me, the difference is insane."
```

# PART 2: THE BODY (Loop Architecture)

## Breaking Beliefs (Before Main Content)

**The Old Way:**
> "Most people think the solution is to give AI more detailed prompts. 'Use Inter font, use this exact hex code, add 16px padding...' But that's exhausting."

**The Breakdown:**
> "The problem is AI doesn't UNDERSTAND why those choices work. It's just following orders without any design knowledge."

**The New Mechanism:**
> "What if instead of telling AI WHAT to do... you taught it HOW to think about design? That's what a skill does."

---

## Main Points Structure

Based on Phase 1 outline, here are the main points:

| Point | Content | Loop |
|-------|---------|------|
| **1** | The Problem (Why AI designs suck) | Open: "But first, let's see how bad it really is..." |
| **2** | The Solution Overview (Skills + Workflow) | Open: "So how do we fix this?" |
| **3** | Installation & Setup | Open: "Here's where it gets interesting..." |
| **4** | Live Demo - The Workflow | Open: "Let me show you what happens when you run this..." |
| **5** | The Comparison (3-way test) | Open: "But does it ACTUALLY work? Let's test it..." |
| **6** | Weak Model Flex (Bonus) | Open: "What about cheaper models?" |

---

## POINT 1: The Problem (1:00-3:00)

### Open Loop
> "Before we fix anything, let me show you how bad it really is. I'm going to ask a vanilla AI to build a landing page... and I want you to cringe with me."

### Content (DISC Layered)
- **D (Result):** "This is what 99% of AI users get. Generic. Boring. Unusable."
- **I (Story):** "I used to spend HOURS fixing colors and fonts after every generation. It was painful."
- **S (Step):** [Show screen recording of vanilla AI output]
- **C (Data):** "The AI has no concept of color harmony, typography pairing, or UX patterns."

### Visual Cue
[B-ROLL: Screen recording of bad AI design output]

### Payoff
> "This is the garbage. Now let's turn it into gold."

### Bridge to Next
> "The fix isn't more detailed prompts... it's giving AI a design brain. Here's how."

---

## POINT 2: The Solution Overview (3:00-5:00)

### Open Loop
> "So how do we actually teach AI to design? Two words: Skills and Workflows."

### Content (DISC Layered)
- **D (Result):** "Skills are files that teach AI new abilities. Workflows tell it WHEN to use them."
- **I (Story):** "I found this UI/UX Pro Max skill online - 50+ styles, 97 color palettes, 57 font pairings..."
- **S (Step):** "Combined it with my own workflow called init_vibecode_design..."
- **C (Data):** "Unlike MCP servers that occupy context from the start, skills only load when the AI decides to use them."

### Visual Cue
[GRAPHIC: Skills folder structure, workflow diagram]

### Payoff
> "You get a design system engine that runs automatically."

### Bridge to Next
> "Let me show you how to set this up in 60 seconds..."

---

## POINT 3: Installation & Setup (5:00-7:00)

### Open Loop
> "Here's where most people get scared - but don't. This is literally copy-paste."

### Content (DISC Layered)
- **D (Result):** "Drop these files in your skills folder. Done."
- **I (Story):** "I actually forked the original repo to add global directory installation - the creators made it work only in your current directory with npm install. My version works globally."
- **S (Step-by-Step):**
  1. "Go to your global skills folder"
  2. "Copy my forked UI/UX skill"
  3. "Copy my workflow"
  4. "That's it. The AI reads them automatically."
- **C (Data):** "Skills are just markdown files + scripts. No complex setup. And unlike MCP servers, they don't eat your context until the AI decides to use them."

### Visual Cue
[SCREEN RECORDING: Copying files to skills folder]

### Payoff
> "You now have a design brain installed. But using it is the fun part..."

### Bridge to Next
> "Let me run the workflow and show you what happens..."

---

## POINT 4: Live Demo - The Workflow (7:00-12:00)

### Open Loop
> "Watch what happens when I tell the AI to design something NOW..."

### Content (DISC Layered)
- **D (Result):** "Look at that. Proper colors. Proper typography. Proper spacing."
- **I (Story):** "The first time I ran this, I was shocked. It just... worked."
- **S (Step-by-Step):**
  1. "Run the workflow - it interviews you about the vibe"
  2. "It generates a complete design system"
  3. "Then creates page mockups"
  4. "All production-ready"
- **C (Data):** "The skill database has 97 researched color palettes matching to product types."

### Visual Cue
[SCREEN RECORDING: Full workflow demo]
[30-SEC SNAP: Show the before/after comparison]

### Payoff
> "That's the same AI that made garbage before. Same model. Different result."

### Bridge to Next
> "But you might be thinking... does this actually work, or did I just get lucky?"

---

## POINT 5: The Comparison - 3-Way Test (12:00-15:00)

### Open Loop
> "Let's put this to the test. Same prompt. Three different setups. Which one wins?"

### Content (DISC Layered)
- **D (Result):** "Test 1: Garbage. Test 2: Okay. Test 3: Professional."
- **S (Step):**
  1. "Vanilla AI - no skills, no workflow"
  2. "Workflow only - my process, but no skill database"
  3. "Workflow + UI/UX Skill - the full stack"
- **C (Data):** Show side-by-side comparison

### Visual Cue
[SPLIT SCREEN: All 3 results side by side]
[30-SEC SNAP: Zoom in on the differences]

### Payoff
> "The skill doesn't just make it prettier - it makes it CORRECT. Proper contrast, proper spacing, proper everything."

### Bridge to Next (Bonus)
> "And here's the craziest part... it even works on cheap models."

---

## POINT 6: Weak Model Flex - Bonus (15:00-16:00)

### Open Loop
> "What if you can't afford Claude or GPT-4? Watch this."

### Content
- Run the same test with a weaker/cheaper model
- Show it still produces decent output
- "The skill compensates for the model's limitations"

### Visual Cue
[SCREEN RECORDING: Weak model output]

### Payoff
> "Even [model name] produced this with no stress. The skill is doing the heavy lifting."

---

# PART 3: THE OUTRO (16:00-17:00)

## Bridge Strategy

### Link the Problem (Created by this video)
> "Now you have the design skill... but what about building the actual app? The code?"

### The Solution (Next Video)
> "That's where my coding workflow comes in. Same AI, same approach - but for code."

### The CTA
> "If you want to see how I turn these mockups into working apps without writing code manually, watch this next."
