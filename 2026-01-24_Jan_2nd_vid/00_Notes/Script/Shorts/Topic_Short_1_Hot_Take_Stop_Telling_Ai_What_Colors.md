# 🎬 PHASE 3.5: SHORTS VISUAL SPECIFICATIONS (B-ROLL & ANIMATION)

This document outlines the frame-by-frame visual requirements for the 6 shorts. These instructions are designed for an animator or Remotion developer to build high-energy, visually engaging clips.

**General Style Guide:**
*   **Pacing:** Fast, snappy cuts. No static frames longer than 2 seconds.
*   **Typography:** Bold, Sans-Serif (Inter/Roboto), Heavy weights. White text on dark backgrounds or high contrast.
*   **Colors:** Cyberpunk aesthetics (Neon Blue #3B82F6, Neon Purple #8B5CF6, Dark Gray #111827).
*   **Vibe:** Tech-focused, professional but "hacker" energy.

## TOPIC SHORT 1: HOT TAKE ("Stop telling AI what colors to use")
**Audio:** "Stop telling AI what colors to use based. Seriously."
*   **Visual (0:00-0:03):** 
    *   **Action:** Large, aggressive text "STOP" flashes on screen (Red #EF4444).
    *   **Overlay:** A hand or cursor slapping a "Color Picker" tool out of the way.
    *   **Background:** Glitchy static noise.

**Audio:** "Every time you type 'use #3B82F6 for the primary button,' you're wasting your breath."
*   **Visual (0:03-0:06):**
    *   **Action:** Split screen. 
        *   Left: A prompt typing `#3B82F6`. 
        *   Right: A "Trash Can" icon animating open.
    *   **Animation:** The hex code text flies from left into the trash can on the right.

**Audio:** "The AI doesn't understand WHY that color works. It doesn't know color theory. It doesn't know contrast ratios."
*   **Visual (0:06-0:10):**
    *   **Action:** Animated Robot Head (AI) looking confused (??? symbols floating).
    *   **B-Roll:** Quick flashes of color wheels and "Contrast Ratio: FAIL" stamps overlaying a messy UI.

**Audio:** "Now I just say 'build a fintech dashboard' and it picks the right palette on its own."
*   **Visual (0:14-0:18):**
