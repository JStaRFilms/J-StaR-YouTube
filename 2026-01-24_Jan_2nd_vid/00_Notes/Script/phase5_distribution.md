## Post 1: The Hook/Pain (Monday - with main video)

```
Your AI designs look like garbage.

And it's not the AI's fault—it's yours.

Here's what most people get wrong:

❌ Giving AI detailed prompts instead of design knowledge
❌ Manually specifying colors without teaching color theory
❌ Expecting professional output from a model that's never seen a design system

I spent 6 months fixing this across 20+ real projects.

The result? A free skill that makes ANY AI design like a senior designer.

## Post 2: The Insight (Friday Week 1)

```
💡 Skills > Prompts

Here's the difference:

A prompt tells AI WHAT to do.
A skill teaches AI HOW to think.

I stopped giving my AI color codes and started giving it color theory. 

Now it picks palettes that actually work—based on industry, mood, and UX principles.

My secret weapon? An open-source skill with 97 color palettes and 57 font pairings baked in.

I made a full tutorial showing how to install it: [YouTube Link]

## Post 3: The Result/CTA (Wednesday Week 2)

```
Same AI. Same model. Before skills vs after skills.

If you're struggling with ugly AI-generated designs, this will help:

→ Install a single skill file (copy-paste)
→ Run a workflow that interviews you about the project
→ Get a complete design system generated automatically

I tested this on school websites, clinics, churches, and SaaS apps.

It works on expensive models AND cheap ones.
