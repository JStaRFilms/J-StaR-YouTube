# 📌 PHASE 4: PRODUCTION & POST-PRODUCTION

## Video: "Why Your AI Designs Look Like Garbage (And How to Fix It)"

---

# PART 1: PRE-FILMING CHECKLIST

## Setup Basics
- [ ] **Lighting**: Soft, even light on face (window or ring light). No harsh shadows.
- [ ] **Audio**: Mic close to mouth. Test recording before full shoot.
- [ ] **Camera**: 4K, lens clean, frame check (head room, rule of thirds)
- [ ] **Background**: Clean desk/setup. Matches tech/coding vibe.
- [ ] **Script on teleprompter/monitor**: Load FINAL_SCRIPT.md

## Energy Check
**Before filming, rate yourself 1-10. If under 7:**
- 20 jumping jacks
- Drink water
- Watch your favorite viral video
- Come back when you're at 8+

## Recording Order
1. **Main Video** (all sections in order)
2. **Topic Shorts** (3x 60 sec - same energy, same setup)
3. **Extract Short Hooks/CTAs** (3x 5-10 sec each)

---

# PART 2: FILMING PROTOCOL

## The Chunking Method
1. Look at script → Memorize 1-2 sentences
2. Look at lens → Deliver with 110% energy
3. Pause → Repeat

**Clap before each take** for easy syncing.

## Eye Contact Rule
Eyes locked on lens during delivery. Looking away = viewer disengaging.

## Section Recording
| Section | Script Location | Takes Needed |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|
| Hook | 0:00-0:45 | 3 |
| Breaking Beliefs | 0:45-1:30 | 2 |
| Point 1: Problem | 1:30-3:30 | 2 |
| Point 2: Solution | 3:30-5:30 | 2 |
| Point 3: Installation | 5:30-7:30 | 2 |
| Point 4: Live Demo | 7:30-12:00 | 2 |

# PART 6: SEO & METADATA

## Title
```
Why Your AI Designs Look Like Garbage (And How to Fix It)
```

## Description
```
You think AI is bad at design... but the real problem is YOU haven't taught it how.

I spent 6 months testing a custom design skill across 20+ real projects - school websites, clinics, churches, SaaS apps. Now my AI generates production-ready designs on the first try.

In this video, I cover:
• Why your AI designs look generic (the real problem)
• How skills work vs MCP servers (and why it matters)
• Installing the UI/UX Pro Max skill (copy-paste simple)
• Live demo: Watching the design system generate
• 3-way comparison test (vanilla vs workflow vs full stack)
• Bonus: Works even on cheap models
