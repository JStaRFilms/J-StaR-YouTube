# === TOPIC SHORTS (Week 1 - Record Fresh) ===

## TOPIC SHORT 1: HOT TAKE
**Post: Monday (with main video)**

```
"Stop telling AI what colors to use. Seriously.

Every time you type 'use #3B82F6 for the primary button,' you're wasting your breath.

The AI doesn't understand WHY that color works. It doesn't know color theory. It doesn't know contrast ratios.

Instead, teach it the principles. I created a skill that does this automatically.

Now I just say 'build a fintech dashboard' and it picks the right palette on its own.

Full tutorial dropping Monday 👇"

## TOPIC SHORT 2: QUICK WIN
**Post: Wednesday**

```
"Your AI designs are ugly because you're missing this one thing: a design system reference.

Here's the quick fix: Before you prompt, add this line:

'Reference the Tailwind UI design patterns. Use their spacing, their typography scale, their color conventions.'

Boom. Your AI now has a professional baseline to work from instead of guessing.

But that's the manual way. I automated this with a skill file. Full breakdown in my latest video 👇"

## TOPIC SHORT 3: STORY HOOK
**Post: Friday**

```
"Last month I was about to pay $500 for a designer. Then I thought... what if I teach my AI to design instead?

6 months later, I have a system that generates design systems automatically.

Color palettes matched to industry. Typography pairs that actually work together. Spacing that follows real principles.

My AI went from making garbage to making production-ready mockups.

Full breakdown dropping this week. This might save you thousands in design costs."
