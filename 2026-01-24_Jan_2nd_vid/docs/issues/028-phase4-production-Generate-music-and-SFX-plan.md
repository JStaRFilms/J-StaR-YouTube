[Production] Generate music and SFX plan

## Labels
`MUS`, `enhancement`, `production`, `FR-021`

## User Story
As a creator, I want guidance on music and sound effects, so the audio enhances the video's energy.

## Proposed Solution
1. Generate music plan per section:
   - Intro: High energy/tension
   - Body: Subtle driving beat
   - Payoffs: Triumphant swell
   - Outro: Resolving
2. SFX markers inline with edit plan:
   - Graphic fly-in â†’ Whoosh
   - Hard cut â†’ Pop
   - Emphasis â†’ Bass hit

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Music style defined per section
- [ ] SFX markers aligned with edit plan
- [ ] Rule enforced: motion = sound
- [ ] Mood keywords included
- [ ] Exportable alongside edit plan
