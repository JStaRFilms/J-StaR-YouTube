## User Story

6. Card-style display with expand option

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Radio selection works for single-select
- [ ] Checkbox selection works for multi-select
- [ ] Selected state clearly visible
- [ ] Regenerate fetches new options
- [ ] Custom input option available
- [ ] Expand button shows full text
