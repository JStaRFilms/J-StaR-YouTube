`MUS`, `enhancement`, `scripting`, `FR-011`

## User Story
As a creator, I want a scripted hook for the first 45 seconds, structured with proven psychological triggers to maximize retention.

## Proposed Solution
1. Generate 3 options for each step:
   - First Frame (0:00-0:05): Ego trap or contrarian statement
   - Stakes (0:05-0:15): Fear or desire toggle
   - Input Bias (0:15-0:30): Credibility statement
   - Promise (0:30-0:45): "3 steps" digestibility
2. User selects favorite for each step
3. Compile into full hook script preview
4. Include timing markers

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 3 options generated per step
- [ ] User can select one option per step
- [ ] Full hook preview compiles selections
- [ ] Timestamps shown in preview
- [ ] Copy button for full hook
- [ ] Regenerate option per step
