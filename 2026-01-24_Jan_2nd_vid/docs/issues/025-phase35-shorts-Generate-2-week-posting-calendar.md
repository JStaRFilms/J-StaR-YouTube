## Labels
`MUS`, `enhancement`, `shorts`, `FR-018`

## User Story
As a creator, I want a complete posting schedule for my 6 shorts, so I know exactly when to upload each piece.

## Proposed Solution
1. Auto-generate calendar:
   - Week 1: Mon (Main + Topic 1), Wed (Topic 2), Fri (Topic 3)
   - Week 2: Mon (Extract 1), Wed (Extract 2), Fri (Extract 3)
2. Calculate dates from user's publish date
3. Show which content on which day
4. Export option (.ics calendar)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Calendar displays 2 weeks
- [ ] Correct content mapped to each day
- [ ] Dates calculated from publish date input
- [ ] Topic shorts before Extract shorts
- [ ] Export to .ics format option
- [ ] Print-friendly view
