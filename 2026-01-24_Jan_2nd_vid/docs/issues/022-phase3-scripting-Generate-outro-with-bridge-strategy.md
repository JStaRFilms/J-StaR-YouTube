## Title
[Scripting] Generate outro with bridge strategy

## Labels
`MUS`, `enhancement`, `scripting`, `FR-015`

## User Story
As a creator, I want an outro that drives viewers to my next video, not the typical "thanks for watching" that signals exit.

## Proposed Solution
1. User inputs their next video topic (or suggested by AI)
2. Generate 3-part outro:
   - Problem Link: New problem this video created
   - Solution: Next video as the fix
   - CTA: "If you want to [benefit], watch this next"
3. Explicitly avoid: "In conclusion", "That's it", "Thanks for watching"

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Next video topic input/suggestion
- [ ] 3-part outro structure generated
- [ ] No typical exit phrases used
- [ ] CTA is action-oriented
- [ ] Editable output
- [ ] Includes endscreen timing note
