## User Story
As a creator, I want each main point structured with open loops and DISC layers, so viewer retention stays high throughout.

## Proposed Solution
1. User inputs 3-5 main points
2. For each point, generate:
   - Open Loop: Hook that creates curiosity
   - Content: DISC layers (D=Result, I=Story, S=Steps, C=Data)
   - Payoff: Close the loop
   - Bridge: Transition to next point
3. Include visual cue markers inline
4. Drag-to-reorder points

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User can add/remove main points (3-5)
- [ ] Loop structure generated per point
- [ ] DISC content included in each
- [ ] Open loops create genuine curiosity gaps
- [ ] Bridges connect points smoothly
- [ ] Reorder functionality works
