## Labels
`MUS`, `enhancement`, `scripting`, `FR-014`

## User Story
As a creator, I want the script to mark where visual changes should occur every 30-60 seconds, so my editor can follow the retention plan.

## Proposed Solution
1. AI inserts markers: `[A-ROLL]`, `[B-ROLL]`, `[GRAPHIC]`, `[PUNCH-IN]`
2. Display inline with script text
3. Color-code by type
4. Allow user to add custom markers
5. Mark pattern interrupts every 45-60 sec

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Markers inserted automatically every 30-60 sec
- [ ] Color coding: A-Roll=blue, B-Roll=green, Graphic=purple, Punch-In=orange
- [ ] Pattern interrupt markers every 45-60 sec
- [ ] User can click to add custom markers
- [ ] Markers visible in final script export
