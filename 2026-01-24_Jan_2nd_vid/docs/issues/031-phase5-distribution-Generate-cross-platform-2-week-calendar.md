## User Story
As a creator, I want a posting schedule across all platforms, so I maximize reach from one filming session.

## Proposed Solution
1. Generate calendar grid:
   - Columns: YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn
   - Rows: 14 days
2. Map content to days per platform rules
3. Include platform-specific notes (remove YT CTAs for TikTok, etc.)
4. Export options

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All 4 platforms displayed
- [ ] 2-week view showing each day
- [ ] Correct content mapped per platform
- [ ] Platform notes included
- [ ] Export to CSV option
- [ ] Print-friendly layout
