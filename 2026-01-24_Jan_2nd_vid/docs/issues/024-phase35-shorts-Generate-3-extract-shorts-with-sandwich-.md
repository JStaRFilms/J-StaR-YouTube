## Labels
`MUS`, `enhancement`, `shorts`, `FR-017`

## User Story
As a creator, I want 3 shorts clipped from my main video with new hooks/CTAs, so I can repurpose content for Week 2.

## Proposed Solution
1. Analyze main script to identify best sections:
   - Result: Demo/payoff moment
   - Pain: Rant/frustration section
   - Value: Standalone tip
2. Generate for each:
   - Hook (5 sec): New intro that stops scroll
   - Meat: Timestamp reference to main video
   - CTA (5-10 sec): Drive to main video
3. User confirms timestamps

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 3 sections identified from script
- [ ] Hook options generated (3 per section)
- [ ] CTA options generated (2 per section)
- [ ] Timestamp input for clip boundaries
- [ ] Sandwich preview: Hook + Meat + CTA
- [ ] Week 2 posting schedule included
