## 📋 Objective

**Drastically improve the visual quality** of the "Designer vs AI" video. The initial implementation was rejected as "ugly".

## 🎯 Scope

**In Scope:**
- **Scene 1 (Invoice):**
    - **Scale:** Increase Invoice size by 200%. It should fill the frame.
    - **Typography:** Use `Inter` or `Geist` (if available). Bold weights for the price.
    - **Depth:** Add significant `shadow-2xl`, maybe a 3D tilt (`perspective: 1000px`).
    - **Details:** Make it look like a real Stripe/FreshBooks invoice, not a wireframe.
- **Scene 2 (System):**
    - Make the "Brain/Pen" icon feel premium (Neumorphism or high-fidelity SVG).
    - "System Online" text should have a "bloom" or glow effect (even in Light Mode).
- **Scene 3 (Montage):**
    - Ensure grid gaps are perfect.
    - Smooth out easing.
- **General:**
    - **Vibe:** "Mirror's Edge" / "High-Tech Lab".
    - **Light Mode:** Keep it white/gray, but add *texture* (subtle grid, noise).

**Constraints:**
- **Read Skill:** `ui-ux-pro-max` (Use the principles there).
- NO Dark Mode (User strict requirement).

## 📚 Context

### Feedback
User screenshot showed a tiny, basic invoice centered on a massive white void. It lacked:
1.  Scale (Too small)
2.  Depth (Flat)
3.  Professional Typography

## ✅ Definition of Done

- [ ] Invoice looks "Premium" (Stripe-quality UI).
- [ ] "Red X" animation is aggressive and impactful (camera shake?).
- [ ] Comparison slider (Scene 4) clearly shows a massive upgrade.
