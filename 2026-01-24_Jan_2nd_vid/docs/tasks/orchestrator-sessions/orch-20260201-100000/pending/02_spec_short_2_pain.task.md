## 📋 Objective

Create a detailed Video Spec Document in `docs/remotion/Extract_Short_2_Pain_Garbage_Alert_spec.md` for the "Pain/Garbage Alert" short video.

## 🎯 Scope

**In Scope:**
- Generate comprehensive video spec for Extract Short 2 ("Pain/Garbage Alert")
- Document frame-by-frame visual requirements
- Define animations, timing, and sequencing
- Create Zod schema for props
- Follow Remotion Builder workflow exactly

**Out of Scope:**
- Asset creation (Phase 2)
- Component building (Phase 3)

## 📚 Context

### Source Script (Extract_Short_2_Pain_Garbage_Alert)

**Audio:** "This is the garbage you're producing right now."

**Visual Structure:**
1. **HOOK (0:00-0:05):** Warning Sign
   - Yellow Triangle Warning Sign
   - Text: "YOUR CODE = TRASH" (Provocative)
   - Background: Red tint

2. **MEAT (0:05-0:50):** Source footage from "Ugly/Vanilla AI" section
   - Focus on awkward spacing, bad colors, generic look
   - Initial AI output quality issues

3. **CTA (0:50-End):** Gift Box Reveal
   - 3D "Gift Box" opening animation
   - Text: "FREE TUTORIAL"
   - Arrow pointing to comments/description

### General Style Guide (from scripts)
- **Pacing:** Fast, snappy cuts. No static frames longer than 2 seconds.
- **Typography:** Bold, Sans-Serif (Inter/Roboto), Heavy weights. White text on dark backgrounds.
- **Colors:** Cyberpunk aesthetics (Neon Blue #3B82F6, Neon Purple #8B5CF6, Dark Gray #111827)
- **Vibe:** Tech-focused, professional but "hacker" energy.
- **Format:** 1080x1920 (9:16), 30 FPS
