## 📋 Objective

Create a detailed Video Spec Document in `docs/remotion/Extract_Short_1_Result_spec.md` for the "Result" short video.

## 🎯 Scope

**In Scope:**
- Generate comprehensive video spec for Extract Short 1 ("Result")
- Document frame-by-frame visual requirements
- Define animations, timing, and sequencing
- Create Zod schema for props
- Follow Remotion Builder workflow exactly

**Out of Scope:**
- Asset creation (Phase 2)
- Component building (Phase 3)

## 📚 Context

### Source Script (Extract_Short_1_Result)

**Audio:** "Same AI, same model. Before skills vs after skills."

**Visual Structure:**
1. **HOOK (0:00-0:05):** Split Screen Vertical
   - Top: "BEFORE" (Glitchy, BW)
   - Bottom: "AFTER" (Sleek, 4K Color)
   - Text: "SAME AI???" pulsing

2. **MEAT (0:05-0:50):** Source footage from Project Montage
   - Smooth scrolling through design system properties
   - Focus on generated output quality

3. **CTA (0:50-End):** Full Workflow Diagram
   - "Link in Bio" text slides up
   - Blur out effect

### General Style Guide (from scripts)
- **Pacing:** Fast, snappy cuts. No static frames longer than 2 seconds.
- **Typography:** Bold, Sans-Serif (Inter/Roboto), Heavy weights. White text on dark backgrounds.
- **Colors:** Cyberpunk aesthetics (Neon Blue #3B82F6, Neon Purple #8B5CF6, Dark Gray #111827)
- **Vibe:** Tech-focused, professional but "hacker" energy.
- **Format:** 1080x1920 (9:16), 30 FPS
