## 4. User Decision Required ⚡

| Asset | Default | Your Choice |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Brain/Neural Network | Code-gen (SVG Nodes + Lines) | [x] Code-gen / [ ] Image |
| Lightning Effect | Code-gen (SVG Paths) | [x] Code-gen / [ ] Lottie/Image |

*By default, I will implement everything with efficient React/Remotion code for maximum control and resolution independence.*
