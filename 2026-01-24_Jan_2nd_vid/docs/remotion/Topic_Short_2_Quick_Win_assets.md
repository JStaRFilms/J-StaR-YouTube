## 1. Code-Generatable Components ✅
*These can be built entirely with React/SVG code*

| Component | Description | Complexity |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| `UglyWebsite.tsx` | Basic HTML structure, Times New Roman, unstyled links. | Low |
| `ProCard.tsx` | Modern Tailwind card, shadow, rounded, Inter font. | Medium |
| `CodeEditor.tsx` | VS Code style window (Light Theme), typing animation. | Medium |
| `QuickFixStamp.tsx` | SVG/CSS stamp "QUICK FIX" with rotation/slam. | Low |
| `FileDirectory.tsx` | Scrolling file list with highlight on `skills/ui-pro-max/`. | Low |

## 2. Image Prompts for User 🖼️
*None needed!* We will use `lucide-react` for icons (Puzzle Piece, Checkmarks, Arrow) and build the rest with code to ensure high-resolution scaling and "Light Mode" perfection.

## 3. External Assets Needed 📦

| Asset | Type | Description | Action |
|-------|------|-------------|--------|
| Audio | WAV/MP3 | Voiceover from script | You provide (or we use placeholder) |
| Font | Google Font | "Inter" and "JetBrains Mono" | We will load via `@remotion/google-fonts` |

## 4. Your Choices ⚡

Tell me for each:

| Item | Options |
|------|---------|
| Audio | [ ] I'll provide audio file / [ ] Use placeholder silence |

Since you asked for "Light Mode" and "Perfection", I strongly recommend building everything with code components to avoid pixelation and ensure perfect theme matching.
