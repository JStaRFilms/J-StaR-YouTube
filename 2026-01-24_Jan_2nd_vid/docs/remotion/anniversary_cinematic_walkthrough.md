# 🎬 Walkthrough: Anniversary Cinematic Redesign

## Overview
I have created a completely new composition `AnniversaryCinematic` that replaces the previous "cute" version with a high-end "Cinematic Digital Scrapbook" aesthetic.

## 🎨 New Aesthetic
- **Theme**: Digital Scrapbook with Film Grain.
- **Palette**: Deep Navy (#1A1A2E) & Rose Gold (#B76E79).
- **Fonts**: Playfair Display (Serif), Montserrat (Sans), Great Vibes (Script).

## 🎞️ Scenes
1.  **The Spark (0-5s)**: A moody, lens-flared intro with "It started with a Hello".
2.  **The Timeline (5-10s)**: A 3D parallax flythrough of your years together, with milestones floating in space.
3.  **The Convergence (10-15s)**: A bright, elegant transition where names fade in and the ring shimmers.

## 🚀 How to Preview
1.  Ensure the development server is running.
2.  Open the local Remotion Studio.
3.  Select **AnniversaryCinematic** from the sidebar (NOT AnniversaryGift).

## Components
- `ScrapbookTexture.tsx`: Adds film grain and vignette.
- `LensFlare.tsx`: Adds cinematic optical flares.
- `TimelineFlythrough.tsx`: Handles the 3D camera movement in Scene 2.
