Make sure the header has a search bar with 40px height and a profile dropdown, also include a notification bell with a red dot if there are unread messages, table rows should have alternating background colors for readability, columns should be sortable with small arrow icons, mobile view needs a hamburger menu and bottom navigation tabs for core features, buttons should have a 150ms transition on hover with a slight scale effect, use SVG icons from Lucide-React for all interface elements, ensure 4.5:1 contrast ratio for accessibility on all text elements... AND I need a dark mode toggle that switches every single hex code accurately, plus a multi-tenant workspace switcher in the top left, a global search that handles keyboard shortcuts like Cmd+K, data tables must support server-side pagination and infinite scroll, the mobile response must be pixel perfect for every iPhone model from SE to 16 Pro Max, the charts should be interactive with tooltips and zoom functions, and don't forget the custom scrollbar styling to match the brand guide... and literally specify every single pixel's color, position, and transition timing for 100+ pages manually because I don't trust the AI to get it right without 10,000 words of instructions!`),
