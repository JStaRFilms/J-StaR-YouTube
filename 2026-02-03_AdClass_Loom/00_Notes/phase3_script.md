# Phase 3: Script Optimization

> **Format**: Re-edit of existing loom (not fresh script)  
> **Goal**: Optimize hook + add new outro while keeping authentic energy  
> **Primary Title**: "I Recorded This for a Job Application. They Never Watched."

## 🎣 HOOK OPTIONS (Pick One)

### Option A: The Story + Petty Energy (RECOMMENDED)
```
[0:00-0:05] FIRST FRAME
"I recorded this at 11:55pm for a job I really wanted.
They never watched it."

[0:05-0:15] CONTEXT + STAKES  
"So instead of letting it rot in someone's inbox,
I figured—why not show everyone what real vibecoding looks like?"

[0:15-0:25] INPUT BIAS
"I've been building custom AI tools for 6 months now.
Not tutorials. Not theory. Actual tools I use every single day."

[0:25-0:35] PAYOFF PROMISE
"I'm going to show you 4 of them in the next 5 minutes.
Let's go."
```
**Why it works**: Validates the click (job app angle), stacks credibility, creates "prove them wrong" energy.

---

### Option B: The Contrarian
```
[0:00-0:05]
"Everyone's talking about vibecoding.
Nobody's showing you what it actually looks like."

[0:05-0:15]
"No fancy setup. No $500 subscriptions.
Just tools I built to solve my own problems."

[0:15-0:25]
"I've been doing this for 6 months—
4 custom tools, zero gatekeeping."

[0:25-0:35]
"Here's the demo."
```
**Why it works**: Challenges the "all talk, no proof" meta.

---

### Option C: The Challenge
```
[0:00-0:05]
"Can one person build a full developer toolkit with AI?
I tried it for 6 months."

[0:05-0:15]
"Context switcher, code reviewer, file system, CLI suite.
All custom. All free."

[0:15-0:25]
"This was supposed to be a job application.
But since they didn't watch—you get it instead."

[0:25-0:35]
"4 tools. Real demos. Let's go."
```

---

## 📐 BODY (Loop Structure)

The original recording already has natural loops. Here's how to tighten:

### Tool 1: Blink (AI Context Switcher)
```
[OPEN LOOP - existing]
"I hate context switching. So I built a Python tool 
that lets me query AI anywhere on my Windows—instantly."

[DEMO - keep as-is]
- Hotkey demo in Notepad
- Code generation demo
- Resume-from-context feature

[PAYOFF + BRIDGE]
"And that's working anywhere I am on my computer.
But querying AI is useless if your code is full of bugs—
which is why I built this next..."
```
**Visual cue**: Screen recording + zoom on hotkey

---

### Tool 2: J-Star Code Reviewer
```
[OPEN LOOP - existing]
"Whatever I'm shipping—it has to be up to standard.
Security. Logic. No blind spots."

[DEMO - keep as-is]
- Show 9am → 1pm same-day build
- Reviewer workflow command

[PAYOFF + BRIDGE]
"Everything is intertwined for quality at every step.
But good code means nothing if your files are chaos—
which is where this comes in..."
```
**Visual cue**: Terminal + file tree

---

### Tool 3: CreativeOS
```
[OPEN LOOP - existing]
"I call it Creative OS because every time I work,
all my files are properly arranged. Automatically."

[DEMO - keep as-is]
- `cos new AdClass` command
- Folder structure auto-generated
- Git init automatic

[PAYOFF + BRIDGE]
"And that's literally how all my projects work.
But to tie it ALL together..."
```
**Visual cue**: Terminal → folder explorer split

---

### Tool 4: VibeCode Protocol Suite
```
[OPEN LOOP - existing]
"I built the VibeCode Protocol Suite.
A CLI that started as prompts—now it's npm-installable."

[DEMO - keep as-is]
- npm install command
- Skills vs MCP hot take ("skills are better")
- .agent folder breakdown

[PAYOFF - modified for new framing]
"All these are quality-of-life tools I use every day.
And they're free."
```
**Visual cue**: npm output + folder structure

---

## 🎬 NEW OUTRO (Critical)

**DO NOT use the original outro.** The "give me a problem" line was for a job app. New framing:

### Option A: The Petty Callback (RECOMMENDED)
```
"So yeah—that was my job application demo.
They didn't watch it. You did.

If you want to see how I built any of these tools,
or want to try the VibeCode Suite yourself—
link's in the description.

And if you're a company reading this in my YouTube history
thinking 'we should've hired this guy'—
you probably should have."

[END - NO "thanks for watching"]
```

### Option B: The Value Drop
```
"That's 4 tools I use every day.
Zero subscriptions. All custom.

The VibeCode Suite is open source—link below.
If you're vibecoding and want a system that actually works,
start there.

I'll see you in the next one."
```

## ✅ EDITING NOTES

| Timestamp | Edit | Why |
|-----------|------|-----|
| 0:00-0:35 | **Replace with new hook voiceover** | Original opens with "Hi AdClass team"—kill that for public version |
| Throughout | **Cut filler phrases** | "like this", "um", "do you understand?" |
| 3:30-ish | **Keep "skills > MCP" hot take** | Spicy, memorable, will generate comments |
| End | **Hard cut after new outro** | No lingering, no awkward wave |

---

## 📌 PHASE 3 OUTPUT

```
Hook: Option A (Story + Petty) or Option B/C
Body: Original loom with loop markers (minimal cuts)
Outro: New—Petty Callback recommended
Edit Style: Keep raw energy, tighten filler

Primary Cut Length: ~5-6 minutes
```

---

**Pick your hook (A/B/C) and outro (A/B), then we lock and move to Phase 4.**
