## 🎨 Thumbnail Prompts

### **Option A: Candid Frame** (For Titles #1, #8, #10)
```
PROMPT:
YouTube thumbnail, 16:9 aspect ratio, candid webcam screenshot aesthetic. Young Black male developer mid-sentence, slightly disappointed or "really?" expression, wearing casual clothes. Behind him: dark room with monitor showing terminal/code editor with green text. Slight warm orange lamp glow from side. Raw, unpolished look. Subtle film grain. 

TEXT OVERLAY (add in Photoshop/Canva):
- "they didn't watch" — lowercase, white text, slight transparency, bottom-left corner
- OR "real demo" — same style
- Font: Inter or SF Pro, thin weight

VIBE: Authentic, slightly vulnerable, "caught mid-recording" energy
```

### **Option C: Hybrid** (For Title #4 or alt vibes)
```
PROMPT:
YouTube thumbnail, 16:9 aspect ratio, dark developer aesthetic. Young Black male looking directly at camera with confident, knowing expression. Semi-transparent floating UI elements around him: terminal windows, code snippets, folder icons, CLI commands. Dark blue/purple gradient background with subtle glow effects. Clean composition, rule of thirds (face on left third).

TEXT OVERLAY (add in Photoshop/Canva):
- "4 tools" — bold, white or neon cyan, right side
- OR "watch this" — conversational, smaller
- Font: JetBrains Mono or Space Grotesk

VIBE: Polished but not corporate, "I have systems" energy
```
