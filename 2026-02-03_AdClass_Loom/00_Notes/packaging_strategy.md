## The Raw Material (What We're Working With)

**Original Context**: A ~6min Loom recorded for a job application (AdClass submission)  
**Content**: Demo of 4 custom-built tools you use daily:

| Tool | What It Does | Demo Highlight |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| **Blink** | System-wide AI (Python → exe), works anywhere with hotkey | Live streaming AI response in Notepad |
| **J-Star Code Reviewer** | Quality assurance workflow, catches security/logic errors | "Started 9am, now 1pm" - same-day build |
| **CreativeOS** | CLI for auto-organizing files by client/project | `cos new AdClass` → instant folder structure + git init |
| **VibeCode Protocol Suite** | npm-installable skills/workflows for AI agents | "Skills are better than MCP" hot take |

**Video Vibe**: Candid, confident, authentic (you're literally on camera at 5:55am in Nigeria)

## Step 1: The Concept Validation (4 Avatar Questions)

Before we engineer titles, I need your input on these:

### 1. **Avatar**: Who exactly is this for?
Options (pick or refine):
- **A**: Solo devs drowning in context switching who want systems, not chaos
- **B**: Curious engineers skeptical of "vibe coding" who want to see real results
- **C**: Freelancers/consultants who need to ship fast for clients
- **D**: Junior devs wondering how seniors actually work day-to-day

### 2. **Objection**: What does the viewer currently believe that this video will challenge?
Options:
- **A**: "AI coding tools are overhyped toys"
- **B**: "You need expensive tools/subscriptions to be productive"  
- **C**: "VibeCoding = spaghetti code"
- **D**: "Personal dev tools are a waste of time vs just using what exists"

### 3. **Stakes**: What do they LOSE if they scroll past?
Options:
- **A**: Missing out on the actual daily workflow of someone shipping real products with AI
- **B**: Staying stuck in browser-tab hell and context switching forever
- **C**: Never seeing how to build tools that solve YOUR specific problems
- **D**: The raw, unfiltered proof that vibecoding works (not theory, demos)

### 4. **Transformation**: What's the dream outcome? (Be visceral)
Options:
- **A**: "I can actually see myself building stuff like this"
- **B**: "Wait, I could eliminate half my friction with one weekend of coding"
- **C**: "This guy isn't lucky, he has systems - and I can copy them"
- **D**: "VibeCoding isn't chaos, it's orchestrated power when done right"

- "I Built My Own Developer OS (And You Can Too)"

### Angle 3: The "Before/After VibeCoding" Angle
- "6 Months of VibeCoding Changed Everything"
- "What 'VibeCoding' Actually Looks Like (Real Demo)"

### Angle 4: The "Anti-Hype" Truth Angle
- "VibeCoding Isn't What You Think (Watch This)"
- "The Real Reason VibeCoding Works (Most People Miss This)"

### Angle 5: The "Job Application Flex" Novel Angle
- "I Sent This Demo for a Job App—They Never Replied, So Here You Go"
- "The Resume Video Nobody Watched (Their Loss)"

## Thumbnail Direction: Candid vs Designed

### Option A: Use the Candid Frame
**Pro**: Authentic, raw, contrasts the polished YouTube meta  
**Con**: If the frame isn't visually arresting, it won't stop scrolls

### Option B: Designed Thumbnail
**Pro**: Optimized for CTR, can highlight the tools visually  
**Con**: May feel incongruent with the raw loom style

### Option C: Hybrid
Use a candid frame of YOU but add:
- Text overlay (2-3 words max, adds intrigue)
- Subtle color grading
- Tool icons or terminal windows floating behind you

## ❓ Questions for You

1. **Avatar**: Which option (A/B/C/D) best fits who you want watching this? Or give me your own.

2. **Objection, Stakes, Transformation**: Same—pick or refine.

3. **Title Angle**: Which family resonates most? (1-5) I'll generate 10 specific titles in that direction.

4. **Thumbnail**: Candid, Designed, or Hybrid? If candid, do you have a solid frame from the loom you want to use?

5. **Wildcard**: Is there anything from the transcript I missed that YOU think is the real hook?
