## 📝 OPTIMIZED DESCRIPTION

```
I recorded this at 11:55pm for a job application.
They never watched it. So here it is.

This is my actual developer workflow after 6 months of vibecoding.
Not theory. Not tutorials. The tools I built and use every single day.

🔧 What's covered:
00:00 - The job app they never watched
00:35 - Blink: System-wide AI that works anywhere (Python → EXE)
01:45 - J-Star Code Reviewer: Catch bugs before you ship
02:45 - CreativeOS: Auto-organizing file system CLI
03:45 - VibeCode Protocol Suite: npm-installable AI skills & workflows
05:00 - The petty outro

🔗 Try these yourself:
• VibeCode Suite: [YOUR GITHUB URL]
• Blink: [YOUR GITHUB URL]
• CreativeOS: [YOUR GITHUB URL]

Skills > MCP. I said what I said.

## ✂️ EDIT CHECKLIST

Since you're re-editing an existing loom:

### A-Roll Cuts
- [ ] **Remove original intro** ("Hi AdClass team...") — replace with Hook A voiceover
- [ ] Cut all "um", "like this", "do you understand?" filler
- [ ] Remove pauses between demos
- [ ] Trim any awkward transitions between tools

### Add New Audio
- [ ] **Record Hook A voiceover** (0:00-0:35)
- [ ] **Record Outro A voiceover** (end)
- [ ] Optional: subtle background music (low, driving beat)

### Visual Additions (Optional but helps retention)
- [ ] Tool name lower-thirds when each demo starts (Blink, J-Star, CreativeOS, VibeCode)
- [ ] Punch-in (1.2x zoom) on key moments
- [ ] Text pop for "skills > MCP" hot take

### Pattern Interrupts
- [ ] ~1:30 mark: Quick cut or zoom
- [ ] ~3:00 mark: Tool transition graphic
- [ ] ~4:30 mark: Before outro setup
