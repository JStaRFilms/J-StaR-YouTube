## 🎥 FILMING PLAN

### Shot List

| #   | Type                    | Content              | Notes                                                           |
| --- | ----------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Face Cam**            | Hook (0:00-0:45)     | Direct to camera, high energy, memorize 1-2 sentences at a time |
| 2   | **B-Roll Insert**       | You working at desk  | 10-15 seconds, can film separately                              |
| 3   | **Screen Record**       | YouTube scroll       | Record yourself scrolling "google antigravity tutorial" results |
| 4   | **Screen Record**       | Antigravity settings | Show workflow folder setup                                      |
| 5   | **Screen Record**       | Genesis demo         | Run `/init_vibecode_genesis` live                               |
| 6   | **Screen Record**       | Design demo          | Run `/init_vibecode_design` live                                |
| 7   | **Screen Record**       | Build demo           | Run `/build_vibecode_project_v2` live                           |
| 8   | **Screen Record**       | App running          | Show Slideshow Converter working                                |
| 9   | **Screen Record**       | Add feature          | Keyboard nav implementation                                     |
| 10  | **Face Cam (Optional)** | Outro                | Can stay on screen share                                        |

### Filming Tips

- **Chunking Method**: Look at script → Memorize 1-2 sentences → Look at lens → Deliver with 110% energy → Pause
- **Eye Contact**: Locked on lens during delivery (viewer's soul)
- **Energy**: Film 20% higher energy than feels natural—it looks normal on camera
- **Multiple Takes**: Do each face cam line 2-3 times, pick the best

## ✂️ EDIT NOTES

### The Rules

| Rule                  | Implementation                                                   |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Remove the Air**    | Cut ALL gaps, breaths, "ums"—audio should look like a brick wall |
| **3-5 Second Rule**   | Screen must change every 3-5 seconds                             |
| **Pattern Interrupt** | Every 45-60 sec, do something drastic (zoom, SFX, graphic)       |

### Visual Rotation (Cycle Through These)

1. **A-Roll**: Your face or voice
2. **Punch-In**: 1.1x-1.2x zoom on face for emphasis
3. **Screen Share**: The demo
4. **Text Overlays**: Highlight keywords ("Genesis", "Design", "Build")
5. **B-Roll Inserts**: You working (break up long screen sections)

### Timestamps + Visual Notes

| Timestamp   | Visual                   | Action                                |

| 0:15-0:30   | B-roll montage           | You working, typing, coding           |
| 0:30-0:45   | Preview of final app     | Quick tease of Slideshow Converter    |
| 0:45-3:00   | Screen: Settings + Setup | Show folder, explain workflow adding  |
| 3:00-6:00   | Screen: Genesis          | PRD generation, scroll through output |
| 6:00-8:00   | Screen: Design           | Design system + mockups               |
| 8:00-11:00  | Screen: Build            | Terminal, files, app running          |
| 11:00-13:00 | Screen: Add feature      | Keyboard nav, quick test              |
| 13:00+      | Screen or face cam       | Outro with CTA                        |

### Sound Design

| Section      | Music Vibe                           | SFX                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Hook         | High energy, building tension        | Woosh on text overlays                  |
| Body         | Subtle driving beat, not distracting | Pop on workflow command, rise on output |
| Build reveal | Triumphant, resolving                | Success chime when app runs             |
| Outro        | Fade down, clean                     | Subtle click on subscribe CTA           |
