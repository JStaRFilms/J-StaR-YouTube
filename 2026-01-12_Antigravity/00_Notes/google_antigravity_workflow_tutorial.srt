1
01:00:00,133 --> 01:00:00,699
 Everyone is

2
01:00:00,699 --> 01:00:00,933
 using

3
01:00:00,933 --> 01:00:01,366
 anti-gravity

4
01:00:01,366 --> 01:00:01,833
 wrong.

5
01:00:02,266 --> 01:00:02,699
 They open it

6
01:00:02,699 --> 01:00:04,066
 up, ask random

7
01:00:04,066 --> 01:00:05,166
 questions, copy

8
01:00:05,166 --> 01:00:05,933
 paste whatever

9
01:00:05,933 --> 01:00:06,599
 it gives and

10
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:07,533
 then wonder why

11
01:00:07,533 --> 01:00:07,866
 your code

12
01:00:07,866 --> 01:00:08,366
 is a mess.

13
01:00:08,933 --> 01:00:09,466
 I did this

14
01:00:09,466 --> 01:00:10,099
 through four

15
01:00:10,099 --> 01:00:11,166
 weeks and was

16
01:00:11,166 --> 01:00:11,566
 really

17
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:12,000
 frustrating.

18
01:00:12,366 --> 01:00:12,733
 But after

19
01:00:12,733 --> 01:00:13,433
 building 10

20
01:00:13,433 --> 01:00:14,133
 plus projects

21
01:00:14,133 --> 01:00:14,433
 using

22
01:00:14,433 --> 01:00:15,099
 anti-gravity,

23
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:16,500
 not demos, I

24
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:17,133
 figured out a

25
01:00:17,133 --> 01:00:17,733
 workflow that

26
01:00:17,733 --> 01:00:18,566
 actually works.

27
01:00:18,933 --> 01:00:20,066
 A system and

28
01:00:20,066 --> 01:00:20,566
 today I'm going

29
01:00:20,566 --> 01:00:21,033
 to show you

30
01:00:21,033 --> 01:00:21,500
 exactly

31
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:22,666
 how to do it.

32
01:00:22,666 --> 01:00:23,266
 By the end of

33
01:00:23,266 --> 01:00:23,866
 this video you

34
01:00:23,866 --> 01:00:24,733
 have the exact

35
01:00:24,733 --> 01:00:25,766
 system I use

36
01:00:25,766 --> 01:00:26,633
 and to prove it

37
01:00:26,633 --> 01:00:27,366
 works we're

38
01:00:27,366 --> 01:00:27,666
 going to

39
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:28,433
 build this.

40
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:30,066
 A markdown to

41
01:00:30,066 --> 01:00:30,633
 slide your

42
01:00:30,633 --> 01:00:31,766
 converter from

43
01:00:31,766 --> 01:00:32,133
 scratch.

44
01:00:32,833 --> 01:00:33,766
 Let's go.

45
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:37,000
 Before we build

46
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:37,466
 you need to

47
01:00:37,466 --> 01:00:38,166
 understand why

48
01:00:38,166 --> 01:00:38,666
 most people

49
01:00:38,666 --> 01:00:39,400
 fail with

50
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:39,866
 anti-gravity.

51
01:00:40,433 --> 01:00:40,833
 Most people

52
01:00:40,833 --> 01:00:42,533
 just chat, ask

53
01:00:42,533 --> 01:00:43,566
 questions, get

54
01:00:43,566 --> 01:00:44,966
 code, paste it,

55
01:00:45,566 --> 01:00:45,966
 ask another

56
01:00:45,966 --> 01:00:46,866
 question, get

57
01:00:46,866 --> 01:00:47,866
 more code, then

58
01:00:47,866 --> 01:00:48,233
 repeat.

59
01:00:48,666 --> 01:00:49,233
 The problem?

60
01:00:49,766 --> 01:00:50,433
 No structure,

61
01:00:50,966 --> 01:00:51,500
 no plan.

62
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:52,533
 You end up with

63
01:00:52,533 --> 01:00:53,033
 Frankenstein

64
01:00:53,033 --> 01:00:53,533
 code that

65
01:00:53,533 --> 01:00:54,233
 nobody can

66
01:00:54,233 --> 01:00:54,633
 maintain

67
01:00:54,633 --> 01:00:55,666
 including you.

68
01:00:55,666 --> 01:00:56,133
 And the worst

69
01:00:56,133 --> 01:00:56,633
 part is

70
01:00:56,733 --> 01:00:57,800
 anti-gravity is

71
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:58,466
 insanely

72
01:00:58,466 --> 01:00:59,300
 powerful.

73
01:00:59,666 --> 01:01:00,166
 That's why I

74
01:01:00,166 --> 01:01:00,866
 developed the

75
01:01:00,866 --> 01:01:01,266
 Vibe code

76
01:01:01,266 --> 01:01:01,699
 protocol.

77
01:01:02,266 --> 01:01:02,833
 A structured

78
01:01:02,966 --> 01:01:03,666
 way to work

79
01:01:03,666 --> 01:01:04,866
 with the AI.

80
01:01:05,266 --> 01:01:05,866
 Three phrases,

81
01:01:06,466 --> 01:01:06,733
 Genesis

82
01:01:06,733 --> 01:01:08,133
 design build.

83
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:09,366
 But first let

84
01:01:09,366 --> 01:01:09,866
 me show you how

85
01:01:09,866 --> 01:01:10,699
 to set it up.

86
01:01:10,699 --> 01:01:11,800
 Step one, open

87
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:12,466
 anti-gravity.

88
01:01:13,199 --> 01:01:14,233
 Press Ctrl L to

89
01:01:14,233 --> 01:01:14,866
 open the agents

90
01:01:14,866 --> 01:01:15,633
 panel if it's

91
01:01:15,633 --> 01:01:15,766
 not

92
01:01:15,766 --> 01:01:16,333
 already open.

93
01:01:16,633 --> 01:01:17,366
 Click on these

94
01:01:17,366 --> 01:01:17,933
 three

95
01:01:17,933 --> 01:01:18,566
 dots here.

96
01:01:19,233 --> 01:01:20,000
 Click on

97
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,066
 customizations,

98
01:01:21,533 --> 01:01:22,866
 workflows, then

99
01:01:22,866 --> 01:01:23,333
 create a new

100
01:01:23,333 --> 01:01:23,766
 one on that

101
01:01:23,766 --> 01:01:24,033
 global.

102
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:24,633
 Type anything

103
01:01:24,633 --> 01:01:25,166
 you want.

104
01:01:25,633 --> 01:01:25,733
 Right

105
01:01:25,733 --> 01:01:26,466
 click on that.

106
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:28,033
 Click on show

107
01:01:28,033 --> 01:01:28,833
 file location.

108
01:01:29,366 --> 01:01:30,000
 Delete that

109
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:30,733
 random file.

110
01:01:30,733 --> 01:01:31,199
 Drop in the

111
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:31,866
 workflow files.

112
01:01:32,266 --> 01:01:32,966
 I'll link these

113
01:01:32,966 --> 01:01:33,666
 below the like

114
01:01:33,666 --> 01:01:34,033
 button

115
01:01:34,033 --> 01:01:34,599
 completely

116
01:01:34,599 --> 01:01:35,099
 free.

117
01:01:35,099 --> 01:01:35,933
 Now when I type

118
01:01:35,933 --> 01:01:36,533
 forward slash

119
01:01:36,533 --> 01:01:37,766
 and chart I see

120
01:01:37,766 --> 01:01:38,166
 all my

121
01:01:38,166 --> 01:01:38,766
 workflows.

122
01:01:39,266 --> 01:01:39,699
 That's

123
01:01:39,699 --> 01:01:40,133
 the setup.

124
01:01:40,633 --> 01:01:41,366
 Let's use it.

125
01:01:44,766 --> 01:01:45,233
 The single

126
01:01:45,233 --> 01:01:45,566
 biggest

127
01:01:45,566 --> 01:01:46,033
 mistake,

128
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:47,133
 writing code

129
01:01:47,133 --> 01:01:47,833
 before you have

130
01:01:47,833 --> 01:01:48,233
 a plan.

131
01:01:48,466 --> 01:01:48,900
 I'm going to

132
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:49,233
 build the

133
01:01:49,233 --> 01:01:49,766
 markdown to

134
01:01:49,766 --> 01:01:50,166
 slide your

135
01:01:50,166 --> 01:01:50,533
 converter.

136
01:01:51,033 --> 01:01:52,066
 But I'm not

137
01:01:52,066 --> 01:01:52,633
 going to ask

138
01:01:52,633 --> 01:01:53,266
 for code yet.

139
01:01:53,666 --> 01:01:54,033
 I'm going to

140
01:01:54,033 --> 01:01:54,933
 run Genesis.

141
01:01:56,166 --> 01:01:56,566
 I'm going to

142
01:01:56,566 --> 01:01:57,566
 tell it build

143
01:01:57,566 --> 01:01:58,500
 an app where it

144
01:01:58,500 --> 01:01:58,866
 picks the

145
01:01:58,866 --> 01:01:59,666
 markdown and it

146
01:01:59,666 --> 01:02:00,633
 turns into a

147
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:01,233
 swipable

148
01:02:01,233 --> 01:02:02,066
 slide deck.

149
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:03,266
 Watch what

150
01:02:03,266 --> 01:02:03,633
 happens.

151
01:02:04,033 --> 01:02:04,366
 Now we're going

152
01:02:04,366 --> 01:02:05,366
 to set it up

153
01:02:05,366 --> 01:02:06,866
 for five mostly

154
01:02:06,866 --> 01:02:07,733
 because I find

155
01:02:07,733 --> 01:02:08,333
 that it's very

156
01:02:08,333 --> 01:02:09,133
 very good at

157
01:02:09,133 --> 01:02:09,599
 planning.

158
01:02:10,066 --> 01:02:10,933
 And all this is

159
01:02:10,933 --> 01:02:11,566
 available for

160
01:02:11,566 --> 01:02:12,566
 you for free in

161
01:02:12,566 --> 01:02:13,033
 anti-gravity

162
01:02:13,033 --> 01:02:13,500
 depending on

163
01:02:13,533 --> 01:02:14,066
 what plan

164
01:02:14,066 --> 01:02:14,599
 you're on.

165
01:02:14,866 --> 01:02:15,099
 So you

166
01:02:15,099 --> 01:02:15,733
 get to go.

167
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:20,333
 So you can see

168
01:02:20,333 --> 01:02:20,966
 it's asking us

169
01:02:20,966 --> 01:02:21,833
 some questions.

170
01:02:21,833 --> 01:02:22,433
 This is mostly

171
01:02:22,433 --> 01:02:23,366
 because we

172
01:02:23,366 --> 01:02:23,866
 haven't given

173
01:02:23,866 --> 01:02:24,733
 it a lot of

174
01:02:24,733 --> 01:02:25,366
 information.

175
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:26,466
 Pro tip here

176
01:02:26,466 --> 01:02:27,599
 for example if

177
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:28,066
 I'm going to

178
01:02:28,066 --> 01:02:29,033
 pull up like a

179
01:02:29,033 --> 01:02:29,500
 professional

180
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:30,366
 projector I've

181
01:02:30,366 --> 01:02:30,900
 worked on in

182
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:31,333
 the past.

183
01:02:31,833 --> 01:02:32,666
 I usually spend

184
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:34,133
 a lot of time

185
01:02:34,133 --> 01:02:35,866
 feeding in a

186
01:02:35,866 --> 01:02:36,266
 lot of

187
01:02:36,266 --> 01:02:36,733
 information.

188
01:02:37,033 --> 01:02:37,500
 For example

189
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:38,833
 inside the idea

190
01:02:38,833 --> 01:02:40,800
 I dump this.

191
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:41,199
 You see this

192
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:42,199
 this is a full

193
01:02:42,333 --> 01:02:43,066
 voiceover

194
01:02:43,066 --> 01:02:44,366
 transcribe of

195
01:02:44,366 --> 01:02:45,366
 what my plan is

196
01:02:45,366 --> 01:02:45,733
 for this

197
01:02:45,733 --> 01:02:46,033
 project.

198
01:02:46,566 --> 01:02:47,133
 So by the time

199
01:02:47,133 --> 01:02:47,833
 I'm coming back

200
01:02:47,833 --> 01:02:48,066
 into

201
01:02:48,066 --> 01:02:49,266
 anti-gravity I

202
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:49,566
 don't really

203
01:02:49,566 --> 01:02:50,066
 need to spend

204
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:50,800
 that much time

205
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:51,333
 explaining

206
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:52,000
 all this.

207
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:52,833
 So now I've

208
01:02:52,833 --> 01:02:53,466
 answered every

209
01:02:53,466 --> 01:02:54,133
 single question

210
01:02:54,133 --> 01:02:54,966
 that I asked me

211
01:02:54,966 --> 01:02:55,733
 and I just

212
01:02:55,733 --> 01:02:56,266
 hit enter.

213
01:02:56,933 --> 01:02:57,500
 So I'm just

214
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:57,766
 going to

215
01:02:57,766 --> 01:02:58,933
 accept this.

216
01:02:59,699 --> 01:03:00,433
 Now let me show

217
01:03:00,433 --> 01:03:00,733
 you a cool

218
01:03:00,733 --> 01:03:01,166
 feature that

219
01:03:01,166 --> 01:03:01,566
 anti-gravity

220
01:03:01,566 --> 01:03:02,433
 actually has.

221
01:03:02,766 --> 01:03:03,566
 If you open the

222
01:03:03,566 --> 01:03:04,300
 agents manager

223
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:05,066
 here at the top

224
01:03:05,066 --> 01:03:05,599
 and you select

225
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:06,099
 the project

226
01:03:06,099 --> 01:03:06,366
 you're

227
01:03:06,366 --> 01:03:07,066
 presently on.

228
01:03:07,066 --> 01:03:07,466
 For example

229
01:03:07,466 --> 01:03:07,900
 this I've

230
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:08,366
 launched a

231
01:03:08,366 --> 01:03:08,566
 project.

232
01:03:08,966 --> 01:03:09,666
 This is one.

233
01:03:10,066 --> 01:03:10,666
 I can see the

234
01:03:10,666 --> 01:03:11,166
 charts we are

235
01:03:11,166 --> 01:03:12,266
 having in the

236
01:03:12,266 --> 01:03:13,466
 editor but it's

237
01:03:13,466 --> 01:03:13,966
 here now.

238
01:03:14,266 --> 01:03:15,000
 And then here I

239
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:15,466
 can pull up

240
01:03:15,466 --> 01:03:16,266
 this side panel

241
01:03:16,266 --> 01:03:17,666
 here and this

242
01:03:17,666 --> 01:03:17,966
 is where

243
01:03:17,966 --> 01:03:18,533
 anti-gravity is

244
01:03:18,533 --> 01:03:18,933
 going to drop

245
01:03:18,933 --> 01:03:19,500
 what we call

246
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:19,966
 artifacts.

247
01:03:20,233 --> 01:03:20,766
 Basically any

248
01:03:20,766 --> 01:03:21,133
 file that

249
01:03:21,133 --> 01:03:21,566
 anti-gravity

250
01:03:21,566 --> 01:03:22,933
 edits will show

251
01:03:22,933 --> 01:03:23,333
 up here.

252
01:03:24,633 --> 01:03:25,300
 Boom as you can

253
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:26,366
 see it just

254
01:03:26,366 --> 01:03:27,166
 updated this

255
01:03:27,166 --> 01:03:28,199
 file just now.

256
01:03:28,199 --> 01:03:29,266
 It generates a

257
01:03:29,266 --> 01:03:29,900
 full project

258
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:30,366
 requirement

259
01:03:30,366 --> 01:03:30,900
 document.

260
01:03:31,633 --> 01:03:32,433
 Every feature

261
01:03:32,933 --> 01:03:33,633
 every user

262
01:03:33,633 --> 01:03:34,966
 story coding

263
01:03:34,966 --> 01:03:35,533
 guidelines

264
01:03:35,533 --> 01:03:36,566
 specific to

265
01:03:36,566 --> 01:03:37,566
 this project.

266
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:38,566
 It generates

267
01:03:38,566 --> 01:03:39,566
 prompts that

268
01:03:39,566 --> 01:03:40,733
 act as the AI's

269
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:41,066
 instruction

270
01:03:41,066 --> 01:03:41,599
 manual.

271
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:43,066
 And then we can

272
01:03:43,066 --> 01:03:43,900
 just look at the

273
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:44,366
 implementation

274
01:03:44,366 --> 01:03:45,300
 plan it has.

275
01:03:45,766 --> 01:03:46,533
 So it tells us

276
01:03:46,533 --> 01:03:47,099
 that okay this

277
01:03:47,099 --> 01:03:47,766
 is the plan

278
01:03:47,766 --> 01:03:48,333
 this is the

279
01:03:48,333 --> 01:03:49,666
 goal this is

280
01:03:49,666 --> 01:03:51,033
 this and you

281
01:03:51,033 --> 01:03:51,533
 can review

282
01:03:51,533 --> 01:03:52,166
 all this.

283
01:03:52,166 --> 01:03:52,433
 If you don't

284
01:03:52,433 --> 01:03:53,033
 like anything

285
01:03:53,033 --> 01:03:53,733
 it has said

286
01:03:53,733 --> 01:03:54,666
 here you can

287
01:03:54,666 --> 01:03:55,166
 basically see

288
01:03:55,166 --> 01:03:55,433
 how I

289
01:03:55,433 --> 01:03:55,866
 highlighted

290
01:03:55,866 --> 01:03:56,466
 this and I can

291
01:03:56,466 --> 01:03:57,000
 just comment

292
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:57,733
 and be like oh

293
01:03:57,733 --> 01:03:58,533
 tweak this

294
01:03:58,533 --> 01:03:59,633
 tweak that add

295
01:03:59,633 --> 01:04:00,699
 a comment it

296
01:04:00,699 --> 01:04:01,633
 shows here you

297
01:04:01,633 --> 01:04:03,066
 submit the end.

298
01:04:03,366 --> 01:04:03,566
 It just

299
01:04:03,566 --> 01:04:04,099
 basically works

300
01:04:04,099 --> 01:04:04,533
 like Google

301
01:04:04,533 --> 01:04:04,966
 Docs at

302
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:05,366
 this point.

303
01:04:06,099 --> 01:04:06,533
 This is

304
01:04:06,533 --> 01:04:07,033
 in code.

305
01:04:07,366 --> 01:04:08,166
 This is the

306
01:04:08,166 --> 01:04:08,633
 blueprint.

307
01:04:09,266 --> 01:04:09,766
 Now when I ask

308
01:04:09,766 --> 01:04:10,466
 for code later

309
01:04:10,466 --> 01:04:11,300
 it knows the

310
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:11,733
 context.

311
01:04:12,033 --> 01:04:12,366
 It knows

312
01:04:12,366 --> 01:04:12,966
 the rules.

313
01:04:13,333 --> 01:04:13,633
 No more

314
01:04:13,633 --> 01:04:14,066
 explaining

315
01:04:14,066 --> 01:04:14,466
 myself

316
01:04:14,466 --> 01:04:15,500
 over and over.

317
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:15,866
 That's the

318
01:04:15,866 --> 01:04:16,366
 first phase.

319
01:04:16,733 --> 01:04:17,866
 Genesis measure

320
01:04:17,866 --> 01:04:19,266
 twice cut once.

321
01:04:19,733 --> 01:04:20,366
 But most people

322
01:04:20,366 --> 01:04:20,800
 would jump

323
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:21,566
 straight into

324
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:22,166
 code now.

325
01:04:22,533 --> 01:04:22,833
 That's

326
01:04:22,833 --> 01:04:23,366
 completely

327
01:04:23,366 --> 01:04:23,833
 wrong.

328
01:04:24,366 --> 01:04:24,866
 There's one

329
01:04:24,866 --> 01:04:25,266
 more step.

330
01:04:25,266 --> 01:04:29,233
 What if I told

331
01:04:29,233 --> 01:04:29,433
 you

332
01:04:29,433 --> 01:04:29,900
 anti-gravity

333
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:30,733
 could design

334
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:31,900
 your whole UI

335
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:32,933
 without writing

336
01:04:32,933 --> 01:04:33,633
 any code.

337
01:04:33,633 --> 01:04:34,199
 Phase two is

338
01:04:34,199 --> 01:04:34,633
 design.

339
01:04:35,166 --> 01:04:35,866
 Running it now.

340
01:04:36,333 --> 01:04:37,333
 And switch back

341
01:04:37,333 --> 01:04:37,833
 to Gemini

342
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:39,433
 3 Pro now.

343
01:04:41,199 --> 01:04:41,599
 Wow.

344
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:42,366
 So it has

345
01:04:42,366 --> 01:04:43,066
 brought me a

346
01:04:43,066 --> 01:04:43,966
 brief for me to

347
01:04:43,966 --> 01:04:44,466
 review.

348
01:04:44,466 --> 01:04:45,366
 It asks what

349
01:04:45,366 --> 01:04:46,133
 the vibe is.

350
01:04:46,133 --> 01:04:46,599
 I might go for

351
01:04:46,599 --> 01:04:47,666
 minimal clean

352
01:04:47,666 --> 01:04:48,199
 maybe

353
01:04:48,199 --> 01:04:48,833
 dark mode.

354
01:04:49,199 --> 01:04:49,866
 I tell you what

355
01:04:49,866 --> 01:04:50,833
 I want and it

356
01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:51,633
 generates a

357
01:04:51,633 --> 01:04:52,400
 custom design

358
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,533
 system with the

359
01:04:53,533 --> 01:04:54,199
 colors I choose

360
01:04:54,199 --> 01:04:54,866
 or if I don't

361
01:04:54,866 --> 01:04:55,433
 have any it

362
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:56,066
 chooses colors

363
01:04:56,066 --> 01:04:56,733
 for me.

364
01:04:57,066 --> 01:04:58,033
 Fonts spacing

365
01:04:58,033 --> 01:04:59,500
 HTML mockups

366
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:00,233
 for the editor

367
01:05:00,233 --> 01:05:00,733
 and slide

368
01:05:00,733 --> 01:05:01,133
 preview.

369
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:02,199
 Look at this.

370
01:05:03,133 --> 01:05:03,666
 I haven't

371
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:04,166
 written a

372
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:04,966
 single line of

373
01:05:04,966 --> 01:05:06,033
 code but I can

374
01:05:06,033 --> 01:05:07,066
 already see the

375
01:05:07,066 --> 01:05:08,033
 app and the

376
01:05:08,033 --> 01:05:08,233
 builder

377
01:05:08,233 --> 01:05:08,966
 followed this

378
01:05:08,966 --> 01:05:09,633
 exactly.

379
01:05:10,166 --> 01:05:10,566
 I didn't want

380
01:05:10,566 --> 01:05:11,266
 to put this out

381
01:05:11,266 --> 01:05:12,033
 here that from

382
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:12,800
 experience I

383
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:13,166
 figured out

384
01:05:13,166 --> 01:05:13,699
 that this is

385
01:05:13,699 --> 01:05:14,400
 way better than

386
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,133
 asking the AI

387
01:05:15,133 --> 01:05:16,433
 to generate an

388
01:05:16,433 --> 01:05:17,333
 image of what a

389
01:05:17,333 --> 01:05:18,266
 mockup could be

390
01:05:18,266 --> 01:05:18,633
 because

391
01:05:18,633 --> 01:05:19,266
 sometimes it

392
01:05:19,266 --> 01:05:19,933
 just ends up

393
01:05:19,933 --> 01:05:20,533
 coughing out

394
01:05:20,533 --> 01:05:21,900
 things that are

395
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:22,833
 literally so

396
01:05:22,833 --> 01:05:23,266
 hard to

397
01:05:23,266 --> 01:05:24,966
 build on UI.

398
01:05:25,366 --> 01:05:26,066
 So telling it

399
01:05:26,066 --> 01:05:26,766
 to write this

400
01:05:26,766 --> 01:05:27,800
 HTML code kind

401
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:28,599
 of grounds it

402
01:05:28,599 --> 01:05:29,599
 in what is

403
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,099
 possible.

404
01:05:30,466 --> 01:05:30,866
 Phase three.

405
01:05:31,566 --> 01:05:32,066
 Now we code.

406
01:05:32,366 --> 01:05:32,900
 So in a new

407
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:33,599
 chart just to

408
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:33,966
 make sure that

409
01:05:33,966 --> 01:05:34,966
 the AI is fresh

410
01:05:34,966 --> 01:05:35,733
 choose whatever

411
01:05:35,733 --> 01:05:36,533
 model you want.

412
01:05:36,533 --> 01:05:36,900
 You can use

413
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:38,433
 Opos45 Gemini 3

414
01:05:38,433 --> 01:05:39,300
 whichever one

415
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:39,766
 you want at

416
01:05:39,766 --> 01:05:39,933
 this

417
01:05:39,933 --> 01:05:40,800
 point is fine.

418
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:41,033
 It's fair

419
01:05:41,033 --> 01:05:41,400
 because you

420
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:41,566
 just

421
01:05:41,566 --> 01:05:42,433
 scaffold in.

422
01:05:42,933 --> 01:05:43,233
 So we're going

423
01:05:43,233 --> 01:05:43,666
 to write

424
01:05:43,666 --> 01:05:44,566
 five code.

425
01:05:44,566 --> 01:05:44,933
 The difference

426
01:05:44,933 --> 01:05:45,533
 between this

427
01:05:45,533 --> 01:05:46,300
 two actually

428
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:47,166
 boils down to

429
01:05:47,166 --> 01:05:47,633
 two things.

430
01:05:47,866 --> 01:05:48,666
 In here we use

431
01:05:48,666 --> 01:05:49,900
 PNPM which is a

432
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:50,466
 package manager

433
01:05:50,466 --> 01:05:51,066
 and here

434
01:05:51,066 --> 01:05:51,933
 we use MPM.

435
01:05:51,933 --> 01:05:52,400
 Recently I

436
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:52,833
 started using

437
01:05:52,833 --> 01:05:53,766
 PNPM so I just

438
01:05:53,766 --> 01:05:54,500
 made sure that

439
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:55,133
 we use it.

440
01:05:55,133 --> 01:05:55,466
 So that's what

441
01:05:55,466 --> 01:05:55,733
 we're going to

442
01:05:55,733 --> 01:05:55,966
 use for

443
01:05:55,966 --> 01:05:56,599
 this demo.

444
01:05:56,599 --> 01:05:56,833
 Enter.

445
01:06:00,066 --> 01:06:00,566
 You could open

446
01:06:00,566 --> 01:06:01,066
 the terminal

447
01:06:01,066 --> 01:06:01,466
 that

448
01:06:01,466 --> 01:06:02,166
 Antigravity is

449
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:02,733
 running here.

450
01:06:02,733 --> 01:06:03,233
 You could open

451
01:06:03,233 --> 01:06:03,866
 it here to look

452
01:06:03,866 --> 01:06:04,633
 at it and see

453
01:06:04,633 --> 01:06:05,233
 all things that

454
01:06:05,233 --> 01:06:05,633
 are happening

455
01:06:05,633 --> 01:06:06,266
 and that we hit

456
01:06:06,266 --> 01:06:06,733
 accept.

457
01:06:07,366 --> 01:06:07,900
 Hitting accept

458
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:08,533
 every time can

459
01:06:08,533 --> 01:06:08,866
 be very

460
01:06:08,866 --> 01:06:09,233
 annoying

461
01:06:09,233 --> 01:06:09,833
 for you.

462
01:06:10,233 --> 01:06:10,800
 If you come to

463
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:11,433
 the Antigravity

464
01:06:11,433 --> 01:06:12,266
 settings here

465
01:06:12,266 --> 01:06:12,733
 you come to

466
01:06:12,733 --> 01:06:13,000
 advanced

467
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,599
 settings you'll

468
01:06:14,599 --> 01:06:16,500
 be able to turn

469
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:17,233
 on like review

470
01:06:17,233 --> 01:06:18,400
 policy, make it

471
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:18,900
 that it always

472
01:06:18,966 --> 01:06:19,666
 proceeds.

473
01:06:20,333 --> 01:06:21,000
 For this I'll

474
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:21,866
 just keep it to

475
01:06:21,866 --> 01:06:22,966
 review request

476
01:06:22,966 --> 01:06:23,900
 review.

477
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:24,666
 Therefore

478
01:06:24,666 --> 01:06:25,066
 terminal

479
01:06:25,066 --> 01:06:25,733
 commands are

480
01:06:25,733 --> 01:06:26,566
 always proceed.

481
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:27,733
 However just

482
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:28,333
 some things

483
01:06:28,333 --> 01:06:28,833
 that are added

484
01:06:28,833 --> 01:06:30,733
 to the

485
01:06:30,733 --> 01:06:31,466
 permission

486
01:06:31,466 --> 01:06:32,766
 allow list and

487
01:06:32,766 --> 01:06:32,966
 also

488
01:06:32,966 --> 01:06:33,699
 denial list.

489
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:34,333
 This is your

490
01:06:34,333 --> 01:06:34,666
 choice.

491
01:06:35,133 --> 01:06:35,766
 Also be very

492
01:06:35,766 --> 01:06:36,199
 careful with

493
01:06:36,199 --> 01:06:36,833
 how you do

494
01:06:36,833 --> 01:06:37,433
 things here.

495
01:06:37,666 --> 01:06:37,966
 You understand

496
01:06:37,966 --> 01:06:38,233
 that kind

497
01:06:38,233 --> 01:06:38,666
 of thing.

498
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:40,000
 Auto open

499
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:40,800
 edited files.

500
01:06:41,333 --> 01:06:41,766
 I turned this

501
01:06:41,766 --> 01:06:42,500
 one off but

502
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:42,933
 basically what

503
01:06:42,933 --> 01:06:43,966
 it does is as

504
01:06:43,966 --> 01:06:44,533
 the file is

505
01:06:44,533 --> 01:06:45,533
 tripping it

506
01:06:45,533 --> 01:06:46,333
 opens them up

507
01:06:46,333 --> 01:06:46,833
 automatically.

508
01:06:47,066 --> 01:06:47,266
 It's your

509
01:06:47,266 --> 01:06:47,566
 choice

510
01:06:47,566 --> 01:06:47,900
 honestly.

511
01:06:48,166 --> 01:06:49,133
 Auto fix links

512
01:06:49,133 --> 01:06:49,866
 is a very good

513
01:06:49,866 --> 01:06:50,233
 addition

514
01:06:50,233 --> 01:06:50,866
 to add.

515
01:06:50,866 --> 01:06:51,466
 Auto continue

516
01:06:51,466 --> 01:06:52,066
 is a good

517
01:06:52,066 --> 01:06:52,833
 addition to

518
01:06:52,833 --> 01:06:53,900
 these two are

519
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:54,533
 good additions.

520
01:06:55,133 --> 01:06:55,533
 Under the

521
01:06:55,533 --> 01:06:56,433
 browser section

522
01:06:56,433 --> 01:06:57,400
 honestly as you

523
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:58,166
 go ideally

524
01:06:58,166 --> 01:06:59,033
 request review

525
01:06:59,033 --> 01:06:59,500
 is good.

526
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:00,033
 If you want to

527
01:07:00,033 --> 01:07:00,766
 be like me you

528
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:01,333
 can just accept

529
01:07:01,333 --> 01:07:02,300
 oh that's fine

530
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:02,733
 I guess.

531
01:07:03,166 --> 01:07:03,599
 So just play

532
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:04,033
 around with the

533
01:07:04,033 --> 01:07:04,466
 settings and

534
01:07:04,466 --> 01:07:05,033
 figure out what

535
01:07:05,033 --> 01:07:05,166
 you

536
01:07:05,166 --> 01:07:05,933
 really like.

537
01:07:05,933 --> 01:07:06,900
 Do well to

538
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:07,633
 provide

539
01:07:07,633 --> 01:07:08,199
 feedback.

540
01:07:08,199 --> 01:07:08,599
 That's a very

541
01:07:08,599 --> 01:07:09,366
 good habit too.

542
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:09,933
 The builder

543
01:07:09,933 --> 01:07:10,766
 reads the PR

544
01:07:10,766 --> 01:07:11,533
 reads the

545
01:07:11,533 --> 01:07:12,333
 mock-ups and

546
01:07:12,333 --> 01:07:13,166
 scaffolds the

547
01:07:13,166 --> 01:07:14,233
 entire project.

548
01:07:14,266 --> 01:07:16,166
 It's creating

549
01:07:16,166 --> 01:07:16,866
 the structure

550
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:17,566
 implementing

551
01:07:17,566 --> 01:07:18,233
 the features

552
01:07:18,233 --> 01:07:19,266
 from the PRD

553
01:07:19,266 --> 01:07:20,266
 matching the

554
01:07:20,266 --> 01:07:20,866
 design.

555
01:07:20,866 --> 01:07:21,266
 So now

556
01:07:21,266 --> 01:07:22,033
 it's done.

557
01:07:22,033 --> 01:07:22,400
 I'll just have

558
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:23,333
 to approve this

559
01:07:23,333 --> 01:07:24,366
 so that it

560
01:07:24,366 --> 01:07:25,099
 checks for

561
01:07:25,099 --> 01:07:25,566
 errors.

562
01:07:25,566 --> 01:07:25,933
 It's going to

563
01:07:25,933 --> 01:07:26,333
 do its own

564
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:27,333
 self-check to

565
01:07:27,333 --> 01:07:27,666
 see if there

566
01:07:27,666 --> 01:07:28,233
 are any errors.

567
01:07:28,533 --> 01:07:29,233
 We close it all

568
01:07:29,233 --> 01:07:30,466
 off with a full

569
01:07:30,466 --> 01:07:31,233
 breakdown from

570
01:07:31,233 --> 01:07:31,966
 the AI telling

571
01:07:31,966 --> 01:07:33,000
 us exactly what

572
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
 it did and how

573
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,033
 we can run this

574
01:07:36,033 --> 01:07:36,433
 project.

575
01:07:37,099 --> 01:07:37,266
 So you

576
01:07:37,266 --> 01:07:38,533
 see done.

577
01:07:39,166 --> 01:07:40,133
 Now I can come

578
01:07:40,166 --> 01:07:41,033
 here and

579
01:07:41,033 --> 01:07:41,833
 basically just

580
01:07:41,833 --> 01:07:43,433
 write PMPM Dev.

581
01:07:44,333 --> 01:07:44,666
 Beautiful

582
01:07:44,666 --> 01:07:45,466
 actually.

583
01:07:47,233 --> 01:07:48,366
 Beautiful actually.

584
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:50,633
 Beautiful

585
01:07:50,633 --> 01:07:52,300
 beautiful

586
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:52,933
 beautiful

587
01:07:52,933 --> 01:07:53,466
 beautiful.

588
01:07:54,566 --> 01:07:55,333
 Mastering the

589
01:07:55,333 --> 01:07:55,833
 prompts.

590
01:07:57,466 --> 01:07:58,333
 Okay and there

591
01:07:58,333 --> 01:07:59,733
 it is running a

592
01:07:59,733 --> 01:08:00,333
 markdown to

593
01:08:00,333 --> 01:08:00,766
 slide through

594
01:08:00,766 --> 01:08:01,233
 converter.

595
01:08:01,866 --> 01:08:02,333
 Typing some

596
01:08:02,333 --> 01:08:02,833
 markdown.

597
01:08:03,266 --> 01:08:03,833
 Hit preview

598
01:08:03,833 --> 01:08:04,800
 slides.

599
01:08:05,666 --> 01:08:06,133
 Three phases.

600
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:07,566
 Genesys

601
01:08:07,566 --> 01:08:09,466
 design build.

602
01:08:10,033 --> 01:08:10,566
 That's the

603
01:08:10,566 --> 01:08:10,866
 entire

604
01:08:10,866 --> 01:08:11,266
 workflow.

605
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:12,933
 Kinda.

606
01:08:15,433 --> 01:08:16,166
 But what if I

607
01:08:16,166 --> 01:08:16,633
 want to add

608
01:08:16,633 --> 01:08:17,233
 something.

609
01:08:17,866 --> 01:08:18,333
 That's where

610
01:08:18,333 --> 01:08:18,966
 the daily loops

611
01:08:18,966 --> 01:08:19,333
 kicking.

612
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:20,266
 Let's add

613
01:08:20,266 --> 01:08:20,666
 keyboard

614
01:08:20,666 --> 01:08:21,166
 navigation

615
01:08:21,166 --> 01:08:22,266
 using arrow

616
01:08:22,266 --> 01:08:23,333
 keys to flip

617
01:08:23,333 --> 01:08:23,833
 the slides.

618
01:08:24,566 --> 01:08:25,000
 I don't just

619
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,466
 say add a

620
01:08:26,466 --> 01:08:27,633
 keyboard nav.

621
01:08:28,066 --> 01:08:28,333
 That's

622
01:08:28,333 --> 01:08:28,866
 terrible.

623
01:08:29,366 --> 01:08:30,066
 I use the daily

624
01:08:30,066 --> 01:08:30,533
 workflow.

625
01:08:31,066 --> 01:08:31,466
 Step one.

626
01:08:31,466 --> 01:08:31,933
 Declare what

627
01:08:31,933 --> 01:08:32,433
 I'm doing.

628
01:08:32,733 --> 01:08:33,466
 It keeps the AI

629
01:08:33,466 --> 01:08:33,966
 focused.

630
01:08:35,066 --> 01:08:35,433
 Step two.

631
01:08:36,033 --> 01:08:36,366
 Make the

632
01:08:36,366 --> 01:08:36,733
 changes.

633
01:08:37,433 --> 01:08:38,333
 AI as a pair

634
01:08:38,333 --> 01:08:38,866
 programmer.

635
01:08:39,633 --> 01:08:40,066
 Step three.

636
01:08:40,666 --> 01:08:41,199
 Close it out.

637
01:08:42,133 --> 01:08:42,733
 Document what

638
01:08:42,733 --> 01:08:43,266
 it's done.

639
01:08:43,766 --> 01:08:44,199
 Now just an

640
01:08:44,199 --> 01:08:45,100
 extra bonus to

641
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:45,733
 help you out.

642
01:08:45,733 --> 01:08:46,333
 If you notice

643
01:08:46,333 --> 01:08:47,166
 it created a

644
01:08:47,166 --> 01:08:47,833
 GitHub issues

645
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:48,333
 folder.

646
01:08:48,733 --> 01:08:49,633
 Now this file

647
01:08:49,633 --> 01:08:50,233
 what you can

648
01:08:50,233 --> 01:08:51,333
 simply do is to

649
01:08:51,333 --> 01:08:51,966
 just basically

650
01:08:51,966 --> 01:08:52,933
 select an issue

651
01:08:52,933 --> 01:08:53,933
 like this and

652
01:08:53,933 --> 01:08:54,666
 you could click

653
01:08:54,666 --> 01:08:55,633
 on this and be

654
01:08:55,633 --> 01:08:56,433
 like implement.

655
01:08:56,833 --> 01:08:57,333
 I just hit

656
01:08:57,333 --> 01:08:57,966
 enter and then

657
01:08:57,966 --> 01:08:58,733
 he just goes

658
01:08:58,733 --> 01:08:59,566
 implement that

659
01:08:59,566 --> 01:09:00,266
 once it's done

660
01:09:00,266 --> 01:09:00,966
 and you like

661
01:09:00,966 --> 01:09:01,733
 what it did you

662
01:09:01,733 --> 01:09:02,166
 click on the

663
01:09:02,166 --> 01:09:03,166
 next and say

664
01:09:03,266 --> 01:09:03,899
 implement.

665
01:09:04,333 --> 01:09:04,800
 Enter.

666
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:05,466
 That way you

667
01:09:05,466 --> 01:09:05,966
 make sure that

668
01:09:05,966 --> 01:09:06,433
 you're only

669
01:09:06,433 --> 01:09:06,966
 feeding the

670
01:09:06,966 --> 01:09:07,766
 agent what it

671
01:09:07,766 --> 01:09:08,566
 needs to

672
01:09:08,566 --> 01:09:09,533
 implement at a

673
01:09:09,533 --> 01:09:09,866
 particular

674
01:09:09,866 --> 01:09:10,399
 time.

675
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:10,666
 And if you

676
01:09:10,666 --> 01:09:11,033
 check your

677
01:09:11,033 --> 01:09:11,333
 project

678
01:09:11,333 --> 01:09:11,733
 requirement

679
01:09:11,733 --> 01:09:12,633
 document here.

680
01:09:13,133 --> 01:09:13,533
 Let me actually

681
01:09:13,533 --> 01:09:14,133
 preview this

682
01:09:14,133 --> 01:09:14,633
 for you

683
01:09:14,633 --> 01:09:15,266
 properly.

684
01:09:15,266 --> 01:09:15,733
 This is what

685
01:09:15,733 --> 01:09:16,266
 the document

686
01:09:16,266 --> 01:09:16,800
 properly

687
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:17,433
 looks like.

688
01:09:17,433 --> 01:09:18,166
 I see a table a

689
01:09:18,166 --> 01:09:19,300
 raised form of

690
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:19,433
 your

691
01:09:19,433 --> 01:09:19,766
 description

692
01:09:19,766 --> 01:09:20,633
 user story

693
01:09:20,633 --> 01:09:21,033
 expected

694
01:09:21,033 --> 01:09:21,766
 behavior and

695
01:09:21,766 --> 01:09:22,166
 outcome.

696
01:09:22,833 --> 01:09:23,500
 Breaking down

697
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:24,600
 exactly what

698
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:25,166
 the application

699
01:09:25,166 --> 01:09:26,366
 should do to

700
01:09:26,366 --> 01:09:27,199
 the AI so that

701
01:09:27,199 --> 01:09:27,933
 it doesn't miss

702
01:09:27,933 --> 01:09:28,566
 any

703
01:09:28,566 --> 01:09:29,566
 single thing.

704
01:09:29,833 --> 01:09:30,233
 And then once

705
01:09:30,233 --> 01:09:30,666
 you're done

706
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:31,300
 with the MOS

707
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:31,833
 and you confirm

708
01:09:31,833 --> 01:09:32,199
 that the

709
01:09:32,199 --> 01:09:32,733
 minimum usable

710
01:09:32,733 --> 01:09:33,733
 state is done

711
01:09:33,733 --> 01:09:34,966
 then you can

712
01:09:34,966 --> 01:09:35,733
 migrate to

713
01:09:35,733 --> 01:09:36,633
 attending to

714
01:09:36,633 --> 01:09:37,133
 future

715
01:09:37,133 --> 01:09:37,833
 requirements.

716
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:38,633
 These are the

717
01:09:38,633 --> 01:09:39,033
 much more

718
01:09:39,033 --> 01:09:39,666
 advanced things

719
01:09:39,666 --> 01:09:40,166
 that will take

720
01:09:40,166 --> 01:09:40,433
 your

721
01:09:40,433 --> 01:09:40,800
 application

722
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:41,833
 from just a

723
01:09:41,833 --> 01:09:42,933
 demo project to

724
01:09:42,933 --> 01:09:43,533
 something

725
01:09:43,533 --> 01:09:44,333
 that's actually

726
01:09:44,333 --> 01:09:44,933
 outstanding.

727
01:09:45,166 --> 01:09:45,633
 So let's

728
01:09:45,633 --> 01:09:45,899
 test it.

729
01:09:46,733 --> 01:09:47,666
 The arrow works

730
01:09:47,666 --> 01:09:48,666
 the feature

731
01:09:48,666 --> 01:09:49,233
 added and

732
01:09:49,233 --> 01:09:50,066
 it's clean.

733
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:50,966
 That's how you

734
01:09:50,966 --> 01:09:51,366
 iterate.

735
01:09:51,733 --> 01:09:51,966
 The system

736
01:09:51,966 --> 01:09:52,466
 keeps you on

737
01:09:52,466 --> 01:09:53,433
 track even

738
01:09:53,433 --> 01:09:54,033
 after the

739
01:09:54,033 --> 01:09:54,766
 initial build.

740
01:09:55,133 --> 01:09:55,633
 Three phases.

741
01:09:56,866 --> 01:09:58,833
 Genesis design build.

742
01:09:59,566 --> 01:10:00,566
 Then you use

743
01:10:00,566 --> 01:10:01,266
 the daily loop

744
01:10:01,366 --> 01:10:01,866
 to keep

745
01:10:01,866 --> 01:10:02,533
 iterating.

746
01:10:02,766 --> 01:10:03,233
 All the work

747
01:10:03,233 --> 01:10:03,833
 full files are

748
01:10:03,833 --> 01:10:04,433
 shown are

 button.

752
01:10:06,466 --> 01:10:06,666
 Three.

753
01:10:07,266 --> 01:10:07,699
 Grab them.

754
01:10:07,699 --> 01:10:08,399

 tutorials

759
01:10:11,033 --> 01:10:11,833
 coming up like

760
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:12,066
 running

761
01:10:12,066 --> 01:10:12,933
 multiple agents

762
01:10:12,933 --> 01:10:13,600
 simultaneously

763
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:14,566
 on the same

764
01:10:14,566 --> 01:10:15,166
 code base.

765
01:10:15,466 --> 01:10:15,766
 Drop in

766
01:10:15,766 --> 01:10:16,366

767
01:10:16,366 --> 01:10:17,633
 you will be

768
01:10:17,633 --> 01:10:18,133
 using the

769
01:10:18,133 --> 01:10:19,166
 system and I'll

770
01:10:19,166 --> 01:10:19,633
 see you in the

771
01:10:19,633 --> 01:10:20,233
 next one.

772
01:10:20,666 --> 01:10:20,833
 Code with

773
01:10:20,833 --> 01:10:21,233
 the vibe.

774
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:22,266
 Code with

775
01:10:22,266 --> 01:10:22,666
 the flow.
