Here are 5 app ideas tailored to a 4-5 minute "speed-build" tutorial using Google Antigravity. These prioritize high visual impact with low logic complexity to keep the demo tight.

### 1. "DevCard" – The Instant Portfolio Generator

**What it is:** A split-screen app where users type their bio/skills on the left, and it instantly renders a stunning, glassmorphism-style personal card on the right.
**Why it works for this video:** It is meta (developers love portfolio tools) and visually dense. The "Design" phase of your workflow can shine here by asking the AI for specific aesthetics (e.g., "Glassmorphism" or "Neo-brutalism"), showing how well the AI handles CSS.
**Key features:**

- Real-time preview (React state handling).
- One-click "Theme Switcher" (Dark/Light/Cyberpunk).
- "Export to PNG" button (simulated or using a simple library).
  **Estimated demo time:** 4.5 minutes

### 2. The "Pomodoro & Lo-Fi" Focus Timer

**What it is:** A minimalist focus timer that changes the background gradient and "breathes" (animates) as the time counts down.
**Why it works for this video:** It demonstrates logic (timers/intervals) and visuals (CSS animations) without needing a database. The visual payoff is high because it looks like a sleek "Zen" productivity tool instantly.
**Key features:**

- Circular progress ring (SVG or CSS conic-gradient).
- Ambient background that shifts colors slowly.
- Editable work/break intervals.
  **Estimated demo time:** 4 minutes

### 3. Markdown-to-Slide Deck Converter

**What it is:** A tool that takes raw markdown text (bullet points) and instantly transforms it into a swipeable, animated presentation deck.
**Why it works for this video:** The transformation from "boring text" to "slick slides" is a great "Aha!" moment for viewers. It fits the workflow perfectly: _Plan_ the parsing logic, _Design_ the slide layout, _Build_ the interactivity.
**Key features:**

- Split pane: Editor vs. Slide Preview.
- Keyboard arrow navigation support.
- Auto-formatting (Headers become titles, lists become bullet points).
  **Estimated demo time:** 5 minutes

### 4. "Expense Visualizer" (The $1000 Challenge)

**What it is:** An interactive dashboard where users start with a $1000 budget and "spend" it by clicking category icons, watching a progress bar drain in real-time.
**Why it works for this video:** Dashboards always look impressive and professional. It allows you to show off how the AI handles data visualization components (charts/bars) and math logic simultaneously.
**Key features:**

- A visual "health bar" for the budget.
- Dynamic list of expenses added.
- Color-coded categories (Food, Tech, Travel).
  **Estimated demo time:** 4.5 minutes

### 5. The "Idea Shuffle" Card Deck

**What it is:** A brainstorming tool that randomizes 3 cards (e.g., "Audience", "Platform", "Topic") to generate content ideas for creators.
**Why it works for this video:** It feels tactile. You can focus heavily on the _Design_ phase to make the cards look 3D and "flippable," which makes for great video B-roll.
**Key features:**

- CSS 3D Flip animations.
- "Lock" button (keep one card, shuffle the others).
- Hardcoded JSON array of prompts (no API needed).
  **Estimated demo time:** 4 minutes
