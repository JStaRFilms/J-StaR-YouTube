### 🅰️ CONCEPT A: "The Fix" (Transformation)
*Best for Title #1 ("Best Way") or #3 ("Workflow")*
- **Visual Strategy**: Classic Split Screen. Chaos vs. Order.
- **Left (Pain)**: Frustrated/Confused face. Dark/Desaturated. Chaos background.
- **Right (Gain)**: Confident/Smirk face. Bright/Vibrant. Structured background.
- **Text Overlay**: "THE FIX" or "WRONG vs RIGHTS"
- **Midjourney/DALL-E Prompt**:
  ```
  Split screen YouTube thumbnail. LEFT SIDE: Cinematic, cool blue tones, a developer looking stressed and confused, hands on head, background is chaotic floating code snippets and glitch effects. RIGHT SIDE: Warm golden tones, the same developer looking confident and smirking, pointing to a glowing structured node-graph workflow in the air. High contrast, 8k, hyper-realistic, highly detailed, dramatic lighting --ar 16:9 --stylize 250
  ```

### 🅱️ CONCEPT B: "The Blueprint" (Intrigue/Secret)
*Best for Title #3 ("Workflow") or #1 ("Best Way")*
- **Visual Strategy**: The "Discovery" moment. Focusing on a physical or digital object.
- **Focus**: You holding a glowing document/schematic that looks like "The Answer".
- **Expression**: "Aha!" / Wide Eyes / Excitement.
- **Text Overlay**: "MY WORKFLOW" or "THE SYSTEM"
- **Midjourney/DALL-E Prompt**:
  ```
  YouTube thumbnail, close up usage of depth of field. A developer holding a glowing futuristic transparent tablet displaying a complex "VibeCode" flowchart diagram. The light from the tablet illuminates the developer's face, who has an expression of shock and discovery. Background is a dark modern high-tech studio with neon accents. Sharp focus on the diagram and eyes. Cinematic 8k, unreal engine 5 render style --ar 16:9 --v 6.0
  ```

### 🅲 CONCEPT C: "The Trap" (Negative/Stat)
*Best for Title #2 ("90% Stuck")*
- **Visual Strategy**: Heavy contrast, red danger colors.
- **Focus**: Large negative stat "90%" + Concerned/Shocked face.
- **Background**: Visual of "Antigravity" breaking or failing.
- **Text Overlay**: "STUCK" or "DON'T DO THIS"
- **Midjourney/DALL-E Prompt**:
  ```
  YouTube thumbnail. Extreme close-up of a developer's face on the right side, expression of deep concern and shock, looking at a massive glowing red "90%" boolean statistic floating in the center. The background features a "Google" search bar that is shattering or dissolving into gravity particles. Dark, moody, high dramatic rim lighting, red and black color palette. --ar 16:9 --style raw
  ```

## Design Specs & QA

### Style Guide
- **Vibe**: Tech-Noir, Premium, High-Contrast.
- **Unacceptable**: Generic stock photos, low-res, boring lighting.
- **Fonts**: Nexa, Kallisto, Berlin Rounded (Bold/Heavy).

### The "Scroll Stopper" Checklist
- [ ] **Glance Test**: Can you understand the story in <2 seconds?
- [ ] **Contrast**: Does the subject pop from the background?
- [ ] **Emotion**: Is the facial expression visceral (not mild)?
- [ ] **Readability**: Is the text (if any) huge and legible on mobile?

## Avatar & Stakes (For Scripting)
| Element | Answer |
|---------|--------|
| **Avatar** | Dev (beginner-intermediate) who tried Antigravity but felt unproductive |
| **Objection** | "I just ask random questions and copy-paste. No structure." |
| **Stakes** | Stay in tutorial hell vs. ship real projects |
| **Transformation** | Overwhelmed → Power user with a system that ships |
