# Google Antigravity Video Script 🎬 (v3 - Final Structure)

> **Title**: I Found the Best Way to Use Google Antigravity  
> **Format**: Face hook (30 sec) → Screencast tutorial  
> **Target Length**: 12-15 minutes  
> **Demo App**: Markdown-to-Slideshow Converter

---

## 🎯 THE HOOK (0:00 - 0:45)

### First Frame Statement (0:00-0:05)

**[VISUAL: You at desk, slight headshake, then direct look to camera]**

> "Everyone's using Google Antigravity wrong."

### Context & Stakes (0:05-0:15)

**[VISUAL: Screen recording - you scrolling through YouTube "google antigravity tutorial" results, fast-forwarded, showing the sea of videos]**

> "They open it up, ask random questions, copy-paste whatever it gives them, and wonder why their code is a mess. I did that too. For weeks. And it was frustrating."

### Input Bias Flex (0:15-0:30)

**[VISUAL: B-roll of you working, code scrolling, montage]**

> "But after building 10+ projects with Antigravity—full apps, not toy demos—I found a workflow that actually works. A system. And today I'm going to show you exactly what it is."

### Payoff Promise (0:30-0:45)

**[VISUAL: Quick preview of the final Slideshow app running]**

> "By the end of this video, you'll have the same system I use. And to prove it works, we're building THIS—a markdown-to-slideshow converter—from scratch. Let's go."

**[TRANSITION: Cut to screen share]**

## 📖 THE BODY: Explain-By-Building

### SEGMENT 1: The Problem + Setup (0:45 - 3:00)

**OPEN LOOP:**

> "Before we build, you need to understand why most people fail with Antigravity..."

**[VISUAL: Screen showing messy Antigravity conversation]**

**THE OLD WAY:**

> "Most people just... chat. Ask a question, get code, paste it. Ask another question. More code. Repeat.
>
> The problem? There's no structure. No plan. You end up with Frankenstein code that nobody can maintain—including you."

**THE BREAKDOWN:**

> "And the worst part? Antigravity is insanely powerful. But without a workflow, you're using maybe 10% of what it can do."

**THE NEW MECHANISM:**

> "That's why I developed the VibeCode Protocol. It's a structured way to work WITH the AI. Three phases: Genesis, Design, Build."

**[VISUAL: Text overlay: "📂 VibeCode Workflow → Link in description"]**

**THE SETUP (How to Add Workflows):**

> "But first—let me show you how to set this up."

**[VISUAL: Screen share - Antigravity settings]**

> "Step 1: Open Antigravity. Go to Settings.
>
> Step 2: Find the Workflows section. You're going to add a folder called `.agent/workflows/`.
>
> Step 3: Drop in the workflow files. I'll link these below—completely free.
>
> Now when I type `/` in the chat, I see all my workflows. That's the setup. Let's use it."

**[TRANSITION - OPEN NEXT LOOP]:**

> "Starting with Phase 1: Genesis. Watch this."

### SEGMENT 2: Genesis - The Blueprint (3:00 - 6:00)

**[VISUAL: Screen share - Antigravity, fresh chat]**

**OPEN LOOP:**

> "The single biggest mistake? Writing code before you have a plan."

**THE DEMO:**

> "I'm going to build a markdown-to-slideshow converter. But I'm NOT asking for code yet. First, I run Genesis."

**[VISUAL: Type `/init_vibecode_genesis` and run it]**

> "I tell it: 'Build me an app where I paste markdown and it turns into a swipeable slide deck.'
>
> Watch what happens..."

**[VISUAL: Show PRD being generated - scroll through it]**

> "It generates:
>
> 1. A full Project Requirements Document—every feature, every user story
> 2. Coding Guidelines specific to THIS project
> 3. A Genesis Prompt that acts as the AI's instruction manual
>
> This isn't code. This is the BLUEPRINT."

**[VISUAL: Show the generated PRD, scroll through it]**

> "Now when I ask for code later, it KNOWS the context. It KNOWS the rules. No more explaining the same thing over and over."

**PAYOFF (Close Loop):**

> "That's the first phase: Genesis. Measure twice, cut once."

**[TRANSITION - OPEN NEXT LOOP]:**

> "But most people would jump straight to code now. That's still wrong. There's one more step..."

### SEGMENT 3: Design + Build (6:00 - 11:00)

**OPEN LOOP:**

> "What if I told you Antigravity can design your entire UI before you write any code?"

**[VISUAL: Screen share - same Antigravity session]**

**THE DESIGN PHASE:**

> "Phase 2 is Design. Running it now..."

**[VISUAL: Type `/init_vibecode_design` and run it]**

> "It asks me about the vibe—minimal, clean, maybe dark mode. I tell it.
>
> And it generates:
>
> - A complete design system—colors, fonts, spacing
> - HTML mockups for the editor and slide preview
>
> Look at this..."

**[VISUAL: Open design-system.html and mockup in browser]**

> "I haven't written a line of code, but I can already SEE the app. The Builder will follow this exactly."

**THE BUILD PHASE:**

> "Phase 3. Now we code."

**[VISUAL: Type `/build_vibecode_project_v2` and run it]**

> "The Builder reads the PRD, reads the mockups, and scaffolds the entire project."

**[VISUAL: Show project being generated, terminal output, file structure]**

> "It's creating the structure, implementing the features from the PRD, matching the design..."

**[VISUAL: Run `pnpm dev` and show app in browser]**

> "And there it is. Running. A markdown-to-slideshow converter.
>
> Type some markdown... hit preview... slides."

**[VISUAL: Demo the working app - type markdown, see slides]**

**PAYOFF:**

> "Three phases. Genesis → Design → Build. That's the workflow."

### SEGMENT 4: The Polish - Adding a Feature (11:00 - 13:00)

**OPEN LOOP:**

> "But what if I want to add something? This is where the daily loop kicks in."

**[VISUAL: Screen share - Antigravity, continuing the session]**

**THE DAILY LOOP:**

> "Let's add keyboard navigation—arrow keys to flip slides.
>
> I don't just say 'add keyboard nav.' I use the daily workflow:
>
> Step 1: Declare what I'm doing—keeps me and the AI focused.
> Step 2: Make the change—AI as pair programmer.
> Step 3: Close it out—document what was done."

**[VISUAL: Quick demo - ask for keyboard nav, implement it, show it working]**

> "Test it... arrows work. Feature added. Clean."

**PAYOFF:**

> "That's how you iterate. The system keeps you on track even after the initial build."

---

## 🔚 THE OUTRO (13:00 - End)

**[VISUAL: Stay on screen share, or quick face cam]**

**NO "Thanks for watching" - Bridge Strategy:**

> "Three phases: Genesis, Design, Build. Then the daily loop to keep iterating.
>
> All the workflow files I showed—linked below. Free. Grab them.
>
> If this helped, subscribe. I've got more advanced stuff coming—like running multiple AI agents on the same codebase at once.
>
> Drop a comment: what do YOU want to build using this system?
>
> See you in the next one."
